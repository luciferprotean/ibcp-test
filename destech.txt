1.1a Anthropometrics





Design is human centred and, therefore, designers need to ensure that the products they design are the right size for the user and therefore comfortable to use. Designers have access to data and drawings, which state measurements of human beings of all ages and sizes. Designers need to consider how users will interact with the product or service. Use and misuse is an important consideration.
Anthropometric data sets can vary significantly between populations. Particularly in the fashion industry, the variance in these data sets impacts the size range of clothes for particular markets.

Anthropometric Data
Term: The aspect of ergonomics that deals with body measurements, particularly those of size, strength and physical capacity.
Term: Static (structural) data – Human body measurements when the subject is still.

The measurements when the body is in a fixed position, i.e static, such as height. joint to joint, skin and bulk.
Data is collected using standardised equipment such as callipers, stadiometer or anthropometer.
Design contexts include chair height, door width, etc



Term: Dynamic (functional) data – Human body measurements taken when the subject is in motion related to range and reach of various body movements. E.g. crawling height, overhead reach and the range of upper body movements.

The measurements that relate a range or reach of various types of body movements such reach, grip strength, reaction times, etc
Basically carrying out a task.
Design contexts in can openers, car console features, book shelving reach, etc

 







Static Data
Dynamic Data



Can opener – requires the dynamic data of grip and torque.







Butterfly Can Opener – can be hard to use for some people.
Ergonomically designed – big easy grip handles and wing nut.




Activity:  On the Padlet match 1 dynamic and 1 static data with a design context.

Primary Data versus Secondary Data
Term: Primary data: Data collected by a user for a specific purpose.

It is collected by the researcher or designer themselves.This would be carried out if there is a specialised group of people that may not have been studied.

Term: Secondary data: Data collected by someone other than the user.

There is a great deal of anthropometric data available. 
It is collected and stored in databases or in books.
Website of a collection of sources.

Reliability and limitations collecting anthropometric data.

Age, gender, ethnicity, etc need to be considered.
Body shape and sizes can change over time.

Percentiles and Percentile Ranges
Term: Percentile range: That proportion of a population with a dimension at or less than a given value.

You need to be able interpret percentile tables for user populations in a design context.

Consider the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles in particular, and percentile ranges such as 2.5th to 97.5th and 5th to 95th.
 In the table (Male Rowers) below of the lightest (least heaviest) rowers are the 5th percentile and they weigh 69.8 kgs or less.
Ergonomic4schools’ Anthropometry section  has a nice table showing design contexts. Take note of when dynamic or static data is used.
interpret percentile tables based on different national and international populations, gender and age. Personal City U on diversity.


When considering percentile ranges the design context factors in as well.

If comfort or safety are important than a range of percentiles must be considered. For example motorcycle helmets need to fit snugly in order to function properly in protecting the head.
If a product is in short use and safety or comfort such as a school desk or waiting room seating, then the 50th percentile would be appropriate.
Interpret percentile tables in order to calculate dimensions related to a product.




Activity: From the table below:

Identify the sitting height of the 50th percentile.
Which is the longest arm length and which group do they belong to?

Percentile Range Curve




Clearance, Reach and Adjustability
Term: Clearance: The physical space between two objects.



eg: two people in a doorway or the space between sitting people.



Term: Reach: A range that a person can stretch to touch or grasp an object from a specified position.



eg arm extension or work envelope.



Term: Adjustability: The ability of a product to be changed in size, commonly used to increase the range of percentiles that a product is appropriate for. 



Car driver seats have many adjustments that can accommodate many people, eg seat height, distance to sterling wheel, even height of the steering wheel.
Often adjustability is used in design contexts where a range of sizes is not possible or expensive to produce.











Adjustability
Reach
Clearance



Range of sizes versus Adjustability





Term: Range of sizes: A selection of sizes a product is made in that caters for the majority of a market.



Clothes or motor cycle helmets come in a range of sizes to accommodate as many percentiles ranges.
This is often done for comfort and safety. If something is not comfortable then it can lead to unsafe situations due to fatigue.



Term: Adjustability: see above.

Bike Sizes and Adjustability

Bicycles use a combination of range of sizes (to suit different heights) as well adjustability (the seat and handle bars).
Consider how products can be adaptable for different markets or adjustable to cater for most.





Design Contexts
Design Contexts from Ergonomic4schools





International-Mindedness
A wide selection of anthropometric data is published and regionalized, for example, Asian data versus western European data. The designer must work with data appropriate to the target market.

Human Factors and Ergonomics – past IB topic
Engineering Anthropometry and work space design1.1b Psychological factors






Human beings vary psychologically in complex ways. Any attempt by designers to classify people into groups merely results in a statement of broad principles that may or may not be relevant to the individual. Design permeates every aspect of human experience and data pertaining to what cannot be seen such as touch, taste, and smell are often expressions of opinion rather than checkable fact.




The analysis of the human information processing system requires a designer to critically analyse a range of causes and effects to identify where a potential breakdown could occur and the effect it may have.





Psychological Factor Data














Term: Human factor data related to psychological interpretations caused by light, smell, sound, taste, temperature and texture.





These factors can better help understand and optimise the user’s safety, health, comfort and performance.
These are a significant part of ergonomics and human efficiency, comfort and safety can be affected by these factors.

Methods of Collecting Psychological Factor Data
Data Collection through 4 types of measurement data scales, which include; nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.














Term: Nominal (Data) Scale – Nominal means ‘by name’ and used in classification or division of objects into discrete groups. Each of which is identified with a name e.g. category of cars, and the scale does not provide any measurement within or between categories.

Nominal scales are very weak, as they do not tell you anything more than that one object is different from another.
Quantitative assessment cannot be made.





Term: Ordinal (Data) Scale – A statistical data type that exists on an arbitrary numerical scale where the exact numerical value has no significance other than to rank a set of data points. Deals with the order or position of items such as words, letters, symbols or numbers arranged in a hierarchical order. Quantitative assessment cannot be made.

When numerals are used, they only indicate sequence or order, for example, ranking someone by placing them in a competition as “third” rather than by a score—they may have come third with 50% right or with 75%.
Quantitative assessment cannot be made.





Term: Interval (Data) Scale –  Interval data are based on numeric scales in which we know the order and the exact difference between the values. Organised into even divisions or intervals, and intervals are of equal size.

An interval scale is a more powerful scale, as the intervals or difference between the points or units are of an equal size, for example, in a temperature scale.
Measurements using an interval scale can be subjected to numerical or quantitative analysis.





Term: Ratio (Data) Scale – A ratio scale allows you to compare differences between numbers. For example, use a rating scale of 1-10 to evaluate user responses.

The difference between a ratio scale and an interval scale is that the zero point on an interval scale is some arbitrarily agreed value, whereas on a ratio scale it is a true zero.
For example, 0°C has been defined arbitrarily as the freezing temperature of water, whereas 0 grams is a true zero, that is, no mass.
Measurements using a ratio scale can be subjected to numerical or quantitative analysis.





This website is very useful.




Qualitative versus Quantitative Data




Term: Qualitative Data – Typically descriptive data used to find out in depth the way people think or feel – their perception. Useful for research at the individual or small (focus) group level.

Nominal or Ordinal Scale (Qualitative) – taste, smell, temperature and texture.
Qualitative data may be used in a design context relating to psychological factors, but individuals vary in their reaction to the data.

For example, one person will find a room temperature comfortable while another person will find it uncomfortable, though the temperature is constant.







Term: Quantitative Data – Data that can be measured and recorded using numbers. Examples include height, shoe size, and fingernail length.

Interval or Ratio Scale (Quantitative) – sound, temperature and light








Human Information Processing Systems

Term: Human information processing system – An automatic system that a person uses to interpret information and react. It is normally comprised of inputs, processes (which can be sensory, central and motor), and outputs.

Can be represented using a flow chart.

Below is a flow diagram; the arrows represent the flow of information through the system.
The boxes represent functional elements in the processing chain, where information is processed.







Flow chart (provided by IB).




Scenario 1: Where we can apply the human information processing system to a common task, such  as a finger in hot water.

Scenario 2: when using a mobile phone to make a telephone call.

The input would be the number to be called.
The sensory processes would be the eyes, which would transmit information to the brain.
The brain is the central processing unit, which examines the information and selects a response coded as a series of nerve impulses transmitted to the hand and muscles.
These are the motor processes, which reconvert the instructions into actions, that is, outputs.


 Activity:
You are driving a car and you see a red traffic light up ahead. Develop a flow chart that represents the human information processing system that would occur.

A Breakdown in the Human Information Processing System (Effects and Reasons)




What happens if the information processing system breaks down?
In the car activity above you would have (hopefully) concluded that the output would be the foot pressing the brake so the car will stop. If there is a break down in the  human information processing system then a car crash is a likely event.

Here the few things could have occurred such as,

Slow reaction time (between seeing the red light and reacting). Stimulus/input as not seen  (Red light or car/pedestrian in the intersection). Response/output was not done/slipped/foot got caught, etc.
In other words,

The information inputs may be incompatible with the sensory receptors.
At the central processing stage, the incoming information may be incorrect or no suitable responses to it are available.
The motor output stage may be unable to perform the actions specified by the central processing unit.





Some reasons include:

 Age – too young and maybe have not learnt the skills (long term memory), too old maybe forget what to do, or too weak to carry out the task.
Strength – too weak to carry out the task
Skills – do not have the necessary skills yet, may have forgotten he skills, skills needed are too complex
Health – when mental or physical health is comprised which may lead to not carrying out the necessary tasks.
Environmental factors – see below for more details.






Effect of Environmental Factors

Term: Environmental factors – A set of psychological factors that can affect the performance of an individual that come from the environment that the individual is situated.

Environmental factors include, sound, temperature, lighting, air quality (pollutants)  and smell.
Environmental factors can affect different individuals in different ways. Individuals react differently to sensory stimuli.

Efficiency and comfort are affected by such factors.


It becomes important to optimize environmental factors to maximize workplace performance.
This can be challenging as user responses to environmental factors are different, some people will find 22C perfect while for others it may too cold! … though the temperature is constant.

Hot n’ Cold

Perception: The way in which something is regarded, understood or interpreted.

The users respond differently to different environmental factors.
Perception has an impact on the accuracy and reliability of psychological factors data
Quantitative data may be used in a design context relating to psychological factors, but individuals vary in their reaction to the data.
For example, one person will find a room temperature comfortable while another person will find it uncomfortable,
How warm or cold work environments can affect the performance of an individual.
 Thermal comfort describes a person’s psychological state of mind and involves a range of environmental factors: air temperature, the heat radiating from the Sun, fires and other heat sources, air velocity (still air makes people feel stuffy, moving air increases heat loss), humidity, and personal factors (clothing and metabolic rate).
Hopefully in an office environment where a number of people work together, the thermal environment satisfies the majority of the people.
Thermal comfort is not measured by air temperature (quantitative), but by the number of people complaining (qualitative) of thermal discomfort.



Activity: 

The above temperature example can guide you for this activity.
Show how users respond differently to each of the following, sound, lighting, air quality and smell.
Put your answers on the class Padlet.



Alertness
Alertness: The level of vigilance, readiness or caution of an individual.
Environmental factors induce different levels of alertness.

Temperature: too warm and you get sleepy and less alert –  too cold and you become more alert. Next time you are on a long haul flight note the temperature fluctuations while flying.
Sound: too loud which can be distracting or even cause harm, high pitched or repetitive on/off noises also become distracting.
Lighting: too dim hard to see things need to get close or strains the eyes, natural versus fluorescent (can affect peoples eyes)
Air quality: excess dust or other pollutants could cause people to find it hard to breathe, maybe cough, etc. Certain essential or aroma oils are said to improve alertness
Smell – bad smells (whew)  will draw ones attention away as opposed to the smell of a hot apple pie.

Identify the general human factors contributing to accidents.: Categories of factors that cause accidents include management (policies, safety education, decision centralization), physical environment (noise, temperature, pollutants, trip hazards, signage), equipment design (controls, visibility, hazards, warnings, guards), the work itself (boredom and repetitiveness, mental and physical workload, musculoskeletal impacts such as force, pressure and repetition), social and psychological environment (group norms, morale), and the worker (ability, alertness, age, fatigue).1.1c Physiological Factors





Designers study physical characteristics to optimize the user’s safety, health, comfort and performance.




Understanding complex biomechanics and designing products to enable full functionality of body parts can return independence and personal and social well- being to an individual.





Biomechanics
Physiological factor data










Types of physiological factor data available to designers:

For example, bodily tolerances such as fatigue and comfort.
muscle strength in different body positions
endurance in different body positions
visual acuity
tolerance to extremes of temperature
frequency range of human hearing,
size
eye/hand coordination
etc





How physiological factor data are collected:
using a wide range of methods, such as performance testing, user trials and observations, collection of anthropometric data, etc











Comfort and fatigue
 
When users interact with products, they may put stress on their bodies which leads to comfort and fatigue. The data designers collect related to comfort and fatigue in form design decisions, such as jar openers for the elderly or people with Arthritis.
Fatigue: When people are put under physical or mental stress/activities for extended periods, fatigue can set in. People react differently when they are fatigued. Errors can creep in which then could prove dangerous. Designers need to understand peoples tolerances and design products and environments that help to reduce fatigue.
Comfort: This various between people. For instance the type of bed that a person will choose is determined by the firmness of the mattress.

Biomechanics

Biomechanics is the research and analysis of the mechanics of living organisms.







The importance of biomechanics to the design of different products considering muscle strength, age of user, user interface (surface texture,  handle size, etc) and torque.

In a kitchen: viewing distances, pulling strength, lifting strength and turning strength.
In a can opener, valve wheel, corkscrew, door handle, jam jar lid – torque becomes important.

As non-renewable resources run out, designers need to develop innovative solutions to meet basic human needs for energy, food and raw materials. The development of renewable and sustainable resources is one of the major challenges of the 21st century for designers.




Much of the development of new resources is the product of creating sustainable solutions to existing problems.




The legacy of the industrial revolution is now being felt as we face resource depletion. The challenge for designers is to continue to develop products that meet the needs of humans, while conserving the environment for future generations.











Renewable and Non-Renewable Resources
Renewable resource
Term: A natural resource that can replenish with the passage of time or does not abate at all

These include, solar, wind, hydro, wave, tidal, thermal and bio fuels
A natural resource qualifies as a renewable resource if it is replenished by natural processes at a rate almost the same as its rate of consumption by humans or other users.





Renewability
Term: This term refers to a resource that is inexhaustible therefore can be replenished quick enough. 

Hardwood trees (such as many rainforest species) take a fair bit of time to mature to a point where is is useable as a resource, therefore, it is considered non-renewable. On the other hand, softwoods (such as pines or conifers) mature more quickly and are considered a renewable resource.

Renewable vs Non renewable




Non-renewable resources
Term: A natural resource that does not replenish at a sustainable rate; a source that will run out if the rate of extraction is maintained.

These include fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, coal, gasohol and nuclear energy
These resources are very useful sources of energy. This energy is needed to manufacture products and provide power to businesses, factories and homes.
The bad aspect about this is that these resources are running out and the human dependency on them is very high.

Reserves
Term: A natural resource that has been identified in terms of quantity and quality.

A proven reserve are those resources that can be economically and technically extracted.
Reserves exist but it might not be viable at this moment such as gold in seawater













Rare Earth Mineral Reserves

Oil Reserves












Economic and Political Importance
The extraction of oil has been at the centre of may issues removing around resource security and international treaties. Students need to understand the issues/impact surrounding resources security for Nations/Governments and international treaties.

Governments need to balance the economic benefits and political impact (including social aspects) of resource extraction.

The Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 is one such example. Iraq was accusing the Kuwait government of ‘slant drilling‘ from the border into Iraqi reserves thus stealing Iraqi oil. It is also thought to be that Iraq invaded in order to procure Kuwaiti oil that were  considered to be 20% of the global reserves. A third reason was that Kuwait was over producing oil this dropping the price of global oil which affect the Iraqi economy.


Often, multinational companies licensed to extract resources have limited consideration for the local population.

Oil companies are often brought into country to explore possible new fields and then develop them. The oil companies pay the government a set amount which can develop wealth. This can produce local employment and other opportunities.
Rare earth minerals/elements which are highly desired/needed and valuable came with a set of issues. For the countries that have them can receive a financial windfall, local communities gain skilled employment, however, the environmental impact for local communities is damaging. An article from the TheGuardian.


The economic and political importance of material and land resources and reserves considering:

set-up cost – typically are high and perhaps national/local governments cannot afford to set-up the infrastructure and the extraction site so outside multi-nationals could be invited.
efficiency of conversion – 
sustainable and constant supply – 
social impact – can bring jobs (skilled and unskilled) and wealth, employment could be permanent or temporary (short term excavation/extraction),
environmental impact – as mentioned above
decommissioning – economically quite expensive especially with  nuclear reactors




International Mindedness
The impact of multinational companies when obtaining resources in different countries/ regions can be a significant issue for the local population and have major social, ethical and environmental implications.
Theory of Knowledge
To what extent should potential damage to the environment limit our pursuit of knowledge?

The abundance of resources and raw materials in the industrial age led to the development of a throwaway society, and as resources run out, the many facets of sustainability become a more important focus for designers. The result of the throwaway society is large amounts of materials found in landfill, which can be considered as a new source to mine resources from.




The exploration of possible solutions to eliminate waste in our society has given rise to ideas developed as part of the circular economy. By redesigning products and processes, the waste from one product can become the raw material of another.




Throwaway then and now












Strategies to Mitigate Waste
Re-use






Term: This is reusing a product in the same context or in a different context.

Reusing is utilising an object more than one time.
This takes into account of conventional reuse where the object is used again for similar purpose, and new-life reuse where it is used for an innovative purpose.
An example of reusing is using disposable plastic or glass bottles to drink water from over again.
Reusing car tyres

Paper resuse into furniture



 Recycle
Term: Recycling refers to using the materials from obsolete products to create other products. 

Recycling consists of processing used materials into novel products in order to avert squandering potentially functional materials.
It decreases the consumption of unsullied raw resources, trims down energy usage, lowering air and water pollution by dropping the need for “usual” waste discarding, and lastly lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
An example of recycling is recycled paper.





Recycled Toilet Paper

Recycling bins















Repair
Term: Is the reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing structure or device.




Repair Manifesto

Wrist watch repair



Recondition
Term: Reconditioning is rebuilding a product so that it is in an “as new” condition, by repairing it, cleaning it, or replacing parts. 

Contexts include car engines,  tyres or refurbished electronics.


Re-engineer











Term: A re-engineered product has been significantly redesigned, with improved engineering, from its original form.

In may: use raw materials that were meant another product or manufacturing process, use environmentally friendly materials, recycle some of the original components, improve performance.
The Dyson Ball Vacuum cleaner has been re-engineered. The vacuum still functions in collecting dust but the method of doing it is different. They redesigned the suction system.

Pollution & Waste

From Wikipedia “Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.[1] Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.
Landfill in Poland
From Wikipedia, Wastes are unwanted or unusable materials. Waste is any substance which is discarded after primary use, or it is worthless, defective and of no use.
Something to ponder? – This is subjective as one persons idea of waste may whereas another person may find it useful!

 Methodologies for Waste Reduction and Designing out Waste
Dematerialization
Term: The reduction of total material and energy throughput of any product and service.
Dematerialization of a Toothbrush

 Dematerialization improves product efficiency by saving, reusing or recycling materials, components and products. 
It impacts on every stage of the product life cycle: in material extraction; eco-design; cleaner production; environmentally conscious consumption patterns; recycling of waste.
 It may mean smaller, lighter products and packaging; the replacement of physical products by virtual products (email instead of paper, web pages instead of brochures); home working, and so on.
Reduction of total material and energy throughput of a product or service, and the limitation of its environmental impact through: reduction of raw materials at the production stage; energy and material inputs at the user stage; waste at the disposal stage
There are potential results of successful dematerialization ..

Product Recovery Strategies at End of Life/Disposal
Term: The processes of separating the component parts of a product to recover the parts and materials.

 Use and recovery of standard parts at the end of product life.
 Recovery of raw materials.
Take back legislation.
Trade in.
Recycling bins/locations.
Employ a circular economy.

Circular Economy




Term: An economy model in which resources remain in use for as long as possible, from which maximum value is extracted while in use, and the products and materials are recovered and regenerated at the end of the product life cycle.





In an economic model that is a closed loop system where the materials/resources are in constant use. At the end of the product life cycle the material waste (or obsolete product material) is recycled/recovered.
The material waste is a resource in the system and is regenerated at he end of the product life cycle.















A circular economy requires designers to consider the subsequent use of materials, components and the embedded/embodied energy in a product. 

This can only be achieved by innovative design and consideration of further cycles of development. 
Designers must ask themselves the question, “How can this product be made to be made again?” 


There are three central strands to this concept: 

cradle-to-cradle (Topic 2.6) design thinking which looks at the whole design and manufacturing process.
design for disassembly (Topic 4.5) which allows for recovery of materials and components.
design inspired by nature that favours diversity and in which there is no waste (biomimicry). 


Innovative design techniques might include: 

the use of smart (shape) memory screws,
dissolvable circuit boards and adhesives (glue),
the use of clips rather than adhesives or screws,
biological materials (such as bioplastics) that can be safely returned to the biosphere with no toxic dyes or other materials.




Equally important are the systems in which the product moves: How will the materials or components be recovered and made use of again.

The designer and manufacturer need to consider this when developing products.


One way forward is to develop different business models where users buy performance through leasing rather than purchasing. This offers interesting job opportunities in creating reverse supply chains as well as engaging design challenges and opportunities.




Splosh – A company has set where a customer purchases a one-off starter kit and then fill the bottle with a sachet of cleaning liquid add warm water and they already to go.
The adding water reduces packing (reduction of materials) and weight (important for transportation – reduction is fuel)
Saves on materials, energy and waste.
If the bottle is reused 20 times it means 95% less packaging waste


The linear and circular models of the economy from Ellen MacArthur Foundation



The above models show the traditional linear, where material is extracted, manufactured and diseased in landfill. The circular model – one of them the bio-waste is returned to enrich the earth. The left model the technical waste is recycled and rescued in the continued production.




 Ellen MacArthur Foundation of Circular economy includes overview, diagrams and case studies.

Final Word: Designing out waste and designing for closed-loop recycling will be more important as resources become scarcer and waste becomes more expensive. Therefore, developing products for product recovery and dematerialization will become an essential element of innovation.









International Mindedness
The export of highly toxic waste from one country to another is an issue for all stakeholders.
Theory of Knowledge
The circular economy can be seen as an example of a paradigm shift in design. Does knowledge develop through paradigm shifts in all areas of knowledge?

Efficient energy use is an important consideration for designers in today’s society. Energy conservation and efficient energy use are pivotal in our impact on the environment. A designer’s goal is to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products or services using newer technologies or creative implementation of systems to reduce usage. For example, driving less is an example of energy conservation, while driving the same amount but with a higher mileage car is energy efficient.




As we develop new electronic products, electrical energy power sources remain an ever-important issue. The ability to concentrate electrical energy into ever-decreasing volume and weight is the challenge for designers of electronic products.









Embodied Energy
Term: Embodied energy – The total energy required to produce a product.
Term: Energy utilization – The method with which energy is used.

Total energy consumed in production (cradle to [factory] gate) and throughout the lifecycle of a product (cradle to grave)
Is the sum of all energy needed to produce a product or service.
It is highly useful to calculate how successful/effective a product or service produces or saves energy.

Distributing Energy: National and International Grid Systems
Term: National and international grid systems – An electrical supply distribution network that can be national or international. International grids allow electricity generated in one country to be used in another.
Term: Energy Distribution -The method with which energy is transported from a source to where it is used.

Energy is distributed over a national and international grid systems
Egypt’s Aswan Dam produces enough electricity that Egypt sells it to The Sudan. On the USA and Mexico border there are three locations where power is sent across the border.
Power nationally distributed is sent for domestic, commercial and industrial use including electric vehicles.
This is a highly centralised grid system.

Local Combined Heat and Power (CHP)
Term: A system that simultaneously generates heat and electricity from either the combustion of fuel, or a solar heat collector.












It is an efficient and clean approach to generating electric power and thermal energy from a single fuel source.
It can either replace or supplement conventional separate heat and power.
Instead of purchasing electricity from the local utility company and burning fuel (oil, gas etc) in an on-site furnace or boiler to produce thermal energy.

This can be taken care of  by an industrial or commercial facility can use CHP to provide both energy services in one energy-efficient step. from the EPA website.

Energy Storage – Batteries, Capacitors and Capacities
Term: Energy Storage –The method with which energy is stored for later use.

Battery is a device consisting of two or more electrochemical cells that convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy (Wikipedia)
Capacitor is an electronic component that temporally stores electrical energy.
Capacity is the amount of electric charge it can deliver (measured in amp-hours)

Clean technology is found in a broad range of industries, including water, energy, manufacturing, advanced materials and transportation. As our Earth’s resources are slowly depleted, demand for energy worldwide should be on every designer’s mind when generating products, systems and services. The convergence of environmental, technological, economic and social factors will produce more energy-efficient technologies that will be less reliant on obsolete, polluting technologies.




The legislation (law) for reducing pollution often focuses on the output and, therefore, end- of-pipe technologies. By implementing ideas from the circular economy, pollution is negated and waste eliminated.













Drivers (push) for Cleaning up Manufacturing:
Manufacturers may react to:

Legislation is a driving force for industry to clean up manufacturing processes.

current or forthcoming legislation (laws)
to conform with government legislation
to avoid penalties


Pressure created by the local community and media

communities have made it known that they don’t want harmful (to humans, ecology and the environment) industries
pressure groups such as Greenpeace or even a small community town
this can sometimes force legislation to be developed and enacted



Reasons for cleaning up manufacturing/industry include:

promoting positive impacts
ensuring neutral impact or minimizing negative impacts through conserving natural resources
reducing pollution and use of energy
reducing waste of energy and resources

 International Legislation and Targets


International legislation and targets are developed for reducing pollution and waste:
Term: Legislation – Laws considered collectively to address a certain topic.

The role and scale of legislation are dependent upon the type of manufacturing and the varied perspectives in different countries.

Legislation (as mentioned above) provides a motivation (perhaps not willingly) for industry to clean up manufacturing processes.

Manufacturers react to the legislation by cleaning up there act or ignoring it (this happens in some countries as legislation not be forced). 
Manufacturers dont want to pay to clean up production; this cuts into profits.


International targets, such as those of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 (see video below),  The Copenhagen Accord in 2009, The Paris Agreement in 2015 are set and agreed upon for reducing green house gases to combat global warming.

The difficulties of getting nations to agree to the targets which can be for many reasons, such as, nations being at different stages of economic and social development, attitudes to the the environment, or placing more value on economic gain than the environment.


Legislation is monitored and policed and how it can be promoted for manufacturers. 
How legislation can be monitoring and policing
The UN on water




Is it ethical to prevent a developing country from producing high carbon emissions through industrial development when developed countries have been the main generators of carbon emissions through their own industrial revolutions and economic development? 

China is a current example as it has done in 20 odd years what it took USA and Europe about 100 years.







Incremental and Radical solutions
Incremental solutions




Term: Incremental solutions – Products which are improved and developed over time leading to new versions and generations.

Often, manufacturing processes are improved in terms of efficiency and amount of embodied energy over time. 

This incremental development of a manufacturing process can require major refits and the addition of new elements to a manufacturing process.
Which allows a company to plan strategically how it will make he changes – this allows for better budget control but requires long term planning.
the impact is not as drastic as radical solutions.






Advantages
Disadvantages


Use of existing trusted technologies.
Take too long.


No/limited down time in production (continued profits)
Small changes may not meet the overall legislation requirements.


Less uncertainty of success due the trusted, known  technology.
Need to make small changes often.


Can quickly respond to legislation (forthcoming or changing).
Saturated (crowded) marketplace/ competition.



Radical solutions
Term: Radical solutions – Where a completely new product is devised by going back to the roots of a problem and thinking about a solution in a different way.





Radical solutions can make a great and sudden impact; 

They can require the replacement of a whole system.
This can be costly and time consuming where a company maybe in down time






Advantages
Disadvantages


Exploration of new technologies.
Costly (both if technology outfitting and loss of profits during down time).


High potential for market growth.
Costly R&D, training and capital (equipment).


Creation of new industries.
High uncertainty of success.


Fewer competitors.
Possibility of high market resistance.


Patening new solutions – financial and repetitional benefits.
Development unpredictable incorporating specific starts and stops.


Enhance reputation and innovative and radical.
 



End-of-Pipe Technologies
Term: Technology that is used to reduce pollutants and waste at the end of a process.

Technology that is used to reduce pollutants and waste at the end of the industries production processes.

Industries include, water, energy, manufacturing, advanced materials and transportation.


Example of this are filters installed on the end of industrial smoke stacks.








End-Of-Pipe
End-Of-Pipe vs Clean Production

Clean Technology
Term: Products, services or processes that reduce waste and require the minimum amount of non-renewable resources.
“Clean technology includes recycling, renewable energy (wind power, solar power, biomass, hydropower, biofuels, etc.), information technology, green transportation, electric motors, green chemistry, lighting, greywater, and many other appliances that are now more energy efficient. It is a means to create electricity and fuels, with a smaller environmental footprint and minimise pollution.

Something Extra …2.5 Green design





The starting point for many green products is to improve an existing product by redesigning aspects of it to address environmental objectives. The iterative development of these products can be incremental or radical depending on how effectively new technologies can address the environmental objectives. When newer technologies are developed, the product can re-enter the development phase for further improvement.



The purpose of green design is to ensure a sustainable future for all.

Green Design – Cradle to the Grave
Term: Green design is the designing of products to have a reduced environmental impact throughout its life.
Sustainable products provide social and economic benefits while protecting public health, welfare and the environment throughout their life cycle—from the extraction of raw materials to final disposal  (cradle to the grave).













Design objectives for green products
Design objectives for green products fall into three categories, materials, energy and pollution/waste.
Materials



Ensuring that the packaging and instructions encourage efficient and environmentally friendly use (this can fall under pollution category as well) materials.
Minimizing the number of different materials used in a product.
Labelling of materials so they can be identified for recycling.
Increasing efficiency in the use of materials and resources.



Energy



Increasing efficiency in the use of energy.



Pollution and waste



Ensuring that the planned life of the product is most appropriate in environmental terms and that the product functions efficiently for its full life.
Analysing and minimizing potential safety hazards (not sure where this goes).
Reducing to a minimum any long-term harm caused by use of the product.
Reducing or negating environmental damage or pollution from the  materials selected.
Reducing or negating noise or smell pollution.
Consider the effects of the disposal of the end of life of the product.




Drivers for green design (consumer pressure and legislation)

Drivers for green design include consumer pressure and legislation, among others. 

Consumer pressure
Term: Collections of individuals who hold a similar viewpoint on a particular topic, for example the environment, who take action to promote positive change to meet their goals.

The public have become aware of environmental issues through media focus on issues such as the destructive effect of chlorofluorocarbons on the ozone layer; acid rain in Northern European forests and the nuclear accident at Chernobyl.
Increased public awareness has put pressure on corporations and governments through voting and purchasing power.
The consumer will seek out products that are energy efficient which will be cheaper to run this providing savings for the consumer.

Legislation
Term: Laws considered collectively to address a certain topic.

Environmental legislation has encouraged the design of greener products that tackle specific environmental issues, for example, eliminating the use of certain materials or energy efficiency.
Raised awareness of environmental issues is increasing legislation in many countries. This can lead to financial penalties on companies who do not demonstrate environmental responsibility. Many people will not behave responsibly unless forced to do so, therefore, legislation forces the issue.

Examples of legislation:
Plastic Labelling

One problem in relation to the recycling of plastics is knowing what the plastic actually is. Government legislation requires labelling plastic products with the plastic type can help overcome this issue.
CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, are harmful greenhouse gases that erode the ozone layer, allowing UV rays to be absorbed and trapped into the Earth and causing global warming. CFCs could be found in Styrofoam, air conditioning coolants, and aerosol cans.
In response (both consumer and government), McDonald chains in several MEDCs (more economically developed countries) were banned from using Styrofoam containers that contained CFCs and were forced to find alternatives to their old packaging. See news article
Green/High-Performance Building Legislation in the States

Green legislation
Catalytic Converter in Cars
Term: Are laws and regulations that are based on conservation and sustainability principles, followed by designers and manufacturers when creating green products.

Green legislation encourages incremental rather than radical changes:

for example, legislation requiring car manufacturers to install catalytic converters for cars (end-of-pipe technology) which tackles the environmental issue of car emissions.
Green legislation is effective as it involves incremental changes (refer to Topic 2.4).



The Designer’s Role
The environmental impact of the production, use and disposal of a product can be modified by the designer through careful consideration at the design stage.
In developing the product brief, formulating the product design specification and choosing the material and manufacturing process, the potential environmental impact of the product is assessed with the specific objective of reducing this impact and minimising it over the longer term.

Strategies for green design (incremental and radical)
Most strategies for green design often involve a focus on one or two
Coca Cola Plant Bottle
environmental objectives when designing or re-designing products. For example bioplastics in place of traditional plastics like in  the PlantBottle from Coca Cola.
There are many other examples of this, such as:

To choose non-toxic, sustainable-produced or recycled materials which don’t need as much energy to process.
To manufacture and produce products using less energy.
To produce products that are long lasting and better functioning so there is less replacement and use of products.
Design products using the concept of being able to recycle it when its use is done.

Incremental:
Term: Products which are improved and developed over time leading to new versions and generations.

Are small changes to the design of the product over a period of time.
This may include changes to:

Materials

use recycled or recyclable materials. Composite materials can be difficult, expensive or cant be recycled.
material optimisation.
limit the number of materials. A tetra pak has multiple layers of materials which, in the past, made it difficult to recycle.


Manufacturing techniques – using clean technology such as end-of-pipe.
Introduce design for disassembly.




Radical:












Term: Where a completely new product is devised by going back to the roots of a problem and thinking about a solution in a different way.

This may include

making big and courageous whole changes to the design of a  product or service.
complete overhaul of the manufacturing process.
using radical clean technology systems







Strategies for designing green products
Most strategies for green design involve focusing on one or two environmental objectives when designing or re-designing a product, for example, the use of recyclable materials.

When evaluating product sustainability consider the following:



Raw materials used:

dematerialization.
low environmental impact materials (eg bio plastics, recycled paper, etc).
use of recycled or recyclable materials.


Packaging:

same as above on ‘raw materials used’.


Reduce incorporation of toxic materials or VoCs:
End-of-life disposal issues:

make it last – reduce obsolescence
enhance recyclability – design for disassembly


Energy in production and use (see next point):
Production methods:

Clean production.
energy efficiency.


Atmospheric pollutants such as VoC’s:





Timescale to implement green design

A reasonable timescale, generally a short 5 years, is implemented for incremental much longer for radical.
This allows for manufacturers to plan and develop design objectives
It is more  cost-effective.

Principles Of Environmental Law
The prevention principle
Term: The avoidance or minimization of producing waste in relation to the production, use and disposal of a product.

Actions should be taken before damage occurs.
This is usually based on a past catastrophe or prior scientific data/research.

The precautionary principle
Term: The anticipation of potential problems in relation to the environmental impact of the production, use and disposal of a product.

Actions should be taken so that the risk of damage is avoided.
There maybe an uncertainty (scientific evidence but perhaps not conclusive) about the risk of environmental harm.
This allows protective measures to be taken without having to wait until the damage materialises.
Fir example, we know that air pollution can cause respiratory illness but how much air pollution is acceptable.










International Mindedness:
The ability and will of different countries to enact environmental legislation varies greatly.
Theory of Knowledge:
Green issues are an area where experts sometimes disagree. On what basis might we decide between the judgments of experts if they disagree?

Design Sustainable Products webpage2.6 Eco-design





Consideration of the environmental impact of any product, service or system during its life cycle should be instigated at the earliest stage of design and continue through to disposal. Designers should have a firm understanding of their responsibility to reduce the ecological impact on the planet. Eco-design concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design.




The smart phone is an innovative example of converging technologies that combines multiple technologies into one space-saving device. The resultant reduction of materials, and energy used in production and distribution has environmental benefits.




Eco-design
Term:  A design strategy that focusses on three broad environmental categories – materials, energy, and pollution/waste.

This makes eco-design more complex and difficult to do.


The Major Considerations of the United Nations Environmental Programme Manual on Eco- design
The UN released a manual on Eco design in 1996. It outlined major considerations:

reduce the creation and use of toxic materials
increase recyclability
reduce energy consumption
increase use of renewable resources
increase product durability – reducing planned obsolescence
reduce material requirements for products and services

The emphasis of the guidelines will vary depending on the type of product to be designed and the target market.
Timescale for Implementing Eco-design

Some factors that can influence the timescale include:

cost, available technology,
radical or whole system overhaul,
eco-design is more complex


all of which can add to the timescale.

 The “cradle to grave” and “cradle to cradle” Philosophy
Term:  Cradle to Grave – A design philosophy that considers the environmental effects of a product all of the way from manufacture to disposal.

It is a key principle of the linear economy.





Cradle to Cradle – Circular Economy

Cradle to Grave – Linear Economy



Term:  Cradle to Cradle – A design philosophy that aims to eliminate waste from the production, use and disposal of a product. It centres on products which are made to be made again.



It is a key principle of the circular economy.
Made to be made – is when a product is designed it is conceived in such a way that it can be made again using the same/most materials/resources of the original product, once it has been disposed of.
Cradle to Cradle ® (C2C) is a holistic approach to design popularized by Professor Michael Braungart and William McDonough. Braungart and McDonough offer Cradle to Cradle ®certification to products that measure up to the standards they set. 
According to their website (www.c2ccertified.org): “The target is to develop and design products that are truly suited to a biological or technical metabolism, thereby preventing the recycling of products which were never designed to be recycled in the first place.”
















 Life Cycle Analysis (LCA)
Term: The assessment of the effect a product has on the environment (LCA) through five stages of its life: pre-production; production; distribution (including packaging); utilization; and disposal.

Designers use LCA to assess and balance environmental impact over a product’s life cycle.
It can highlight areas with opportunities to reduce the environmental impact.
It makes the designer to think about changing product design to reduce the impact such a green or sustainable product designs

LCA stages:

pre-production;

is the obtaining of natural resources;
it can be very polluting (strip-mining) or can have a smaller effect on the environment (shaft mining),
includes transporting the raw material to processing industries


production

is the processing of the resources and shaping etc. to make the product.
Once again it could be damaging to the environment (such as a large factory spewing out smoke) or have a small impact (a carpenter hand crafting children’s toys)


distribution including packaging;

 includes taking the product from the factory to the warehouse, from the warehouse to the store, and the package.
It could have a large impact (as is the case with an imported object from around the world in a Styrofoam box) or a very low impact (made and sold in the same place with a biodegradable box or no packaging)


utilization

is about the product’s use and the effect that has on the environment.
A diesel generator for example will pollute air and make noise pollution while a solar panel will make next to none.


disposal

depends on both the product and the method of disposal. Recycling one aluminum can will make less environmental problems than throwing one away even if they are identical.
Biodegradable objects can be reused, recycled, or left to be broken down and add nutrients to the soil, depending on the object one or the other would be preferable.
Paper is best recycled because of the chemicals used to make it and the logging of forests to obtain the pulp while a banana peel is completely useless for anything but compost.

 Environmental Impact Assessment Matrix
The LCA matrix is a useful tool for designers of eco-products and systems.
LCA Matrix

Benefits of organizing the life cycle stages and the environmental considerations into an environmental impact assessment matrix in which elements differ in importance according to the particular design context.

It is targeted at particular product categories—products with high environmental impacts in the global marketplace, for example, washing machines and refrigerators.


LCA identifies conflicts that have to be resolved through prioritization.
It is not widely used in practice because

 it is difficult, costly and time-consuming.
The complex nature of LCA means that it is not possible for a lone designer to undertake it and a team with different specialism is required. 
LCA is complex, time-consuming and expensive, so the majority of eco-designs are based on less detailed qualitative assessments of likely impacts of a product over its life cycle.


However, in the re-innovation of the design of a product or its manufacture, specific aspects may be changed after considering the design objectives for green products, such as 

selecting less toxic materials or using more sustainable sources. 
a product may be distributed differently.
its packaging may be redesigned.
minimize the use of packaging.
optimize energy efficiency in use.
design for disassembly.
minimize parts/components.
use recyclable materials.

Simple example of an environmental impact assessment matrix – from the IBO


Environmental impact assessment matrices can be infinitely more complex, focusing on one particular stage of LCA at a time and breaking processes down into individual steps, often focusing on an output in terms of resources used, wasted and by-products generated and released.
The simplest example is the use of a checklist to guide the design team during a product’s design development stages. 

The roles and responsibilities of the designer, manufacturer and user at each stage of the product life cycle.

Roles and responsibilities vary between them

Clearly the user/consumer have little control in the early stages but more so in the products use and disposal.

 Product Cycle
Term: Product Cycle – Also known as the product life cycle, it is a cycle that every product goes through from introduction to withdrawal or discontinuation.




Product Life Cycle (a bit dated!)

Product Life Cycle and Marketing







The First Mouse
Where is the computer mouse in  he Product Life Cycle? – SMH Link to the article




Four main stages
There are four main stages of the product life cycle which are, introduction, early, mature and late.

During the early stages the product has just recently been introduced into the market and tends not to sell well and maybe overpriced in order to break-even. It also undergoes many changes.
During the Mature stages of the product cycle the product is now reached its peak where little changes to its design occur and sells very well.
During the late stage the product’s sales decline and becomes obsolete.

Designing is part of the product cycle.

A need is generated and a product is designed, manufactured, and sold.
Product eventually becoming obsolete (out of use).
Distributors, retailers, accountants and production engineers, who all have an affect over the cycle, complicate the cycle.
Unlike in the design process, the designer is not necessarily in control of the cycle.
In CAD (computer aided design) and CAM (computer aided manufacture), the designer actually becomes part of the cycle by creating the prototype from a personal computer.

The role of the designer:

Designing is part of the product cycle: as a need is generated, a product is designed, made and sold, eventually becoming obsolete.
The cycle is complicated by distributors, retailers, accountants and production engineers, all of whom have an influence over the cycle. Although the designer is an integral part of the process, he or she is not necessarily in control (unlike in the design process).
Computer-aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacture (CAM), where a prototype is produced by the designer from his or her personal computer (PC), blurs this distinction.


The role of the manufacturer

In the selection of manufacturing techniques – preferably limiting environmental affect – injection moulding produces very little waste
Quality control – controlling errors and waste
Specify standrad components and sub-assesmblies
Attempt to minimise: energy usage, emissions, water pollution and other elements of the LCA.
This can be done through the introduction of management systems.

The role of the user

Market pull from consumers
Spending patterns – a need for a durable product versus a disposable one
Disposal of the product
Consumers can force designers and manufacturers to be more green usually through their buying power
Provide feedback to manufacturers

 Converging Technologies
Term: The synergistic merging of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information and communication technologies and cognitive science.




Converging Technology

Converging Technology






Advantages
Disadvantages




 A single device with multiple functions
Eliminates the need to buy multiple devices
miniaturization of products increase portability
reduce the need for materials – reduce cost and environmental impact




 if one technology fails could lead to the other contacted tech to fail as well
increased functionality of a device may lead to inefficient use
the converged tech may not work as well as on its own e.g. DVD player vs a dvd player in a game console







An example of converging technology is the smart phone.

consider the smart phone as a converging technology in terms of the materials required to create it, its energy consumption, disassembly, recyclability and the portability of the devices it incorporates.
Functionality: telephone. texting, apps, MP3 Player, video and still camera, phone book, etc


Other examples include mobile health devices such as the FitBit or iWatch or other wearables that have integrated circuits that can monitor body functions.

Designers use conceptual modelling to assist their understanding by simulating the subject matter they represent. Designers should consider systems, services and products in relation to what they should do, how they should behave, what they look like and whether they will be understood by the users in the manner intended.




The starting point for solving a problem springs from an idea developed in the mind. A detailed exploration of the idea is vital to take it from the intangible to the tangible, along with the ability to articulate the idea to others














The Role of Conceptual Modelling in Design
Term: A model that exists in the mind used to help us know and understand ideas.
Conceptual models are

a model of concepts or ideas (abstract) that exist in the mind.
used to help us know and understand, design thinking, ideas, casual relationships, principles, data, systems, algorithms or processes.
used to illustrate relationships that is in the designers mind to others.
able to help explain the thinking behind  new ideas.
able to help us to communicate with other members of  design team, manufacturer or client.
able to help us visualise ideas through graphic, physical and virtual models.

Graphic models such as flow charts may be difficult for people to understand.






























Theory of Knowledge




In the construction of a model, how can we know which aspects of the world to include and which to ignore?3.2 Graphical Modelling

Graphical models can take many forms, but their prime function is always the same—to simplify the data and present it in such a way that understanding of what is being presented aids further development or discussion. Designers utilize graphical modelling as a tool to explore creative solutions and refine ideas from the technically impossible to the technically possible, widening the constraints of what is feasible.

A graphical model is a visualization of an idea, often created on paper or through software. Graphical models are used to communicate with oneself and others which include design team members, the client an the manufacturer. The architect would use plans (orthographic) for the builders but perspective for the client.

Term: Projection Drawings – Systems of drawings that are accurately drawn, the two main types are isometric projection (formal drawing technique) and orthographic projection (working drawing technique).
Term: Scale Drawings – Drawings that are bigger or smaller than the real product, but exactly in proportion with product.
Term: Working Drawings – Drawings that are used to guide the production of a product, most commonly orthographical projection, section drawings, part drawings, assembly drawings and plan drawings.
Orthogonal/Orthographic Drawings/Projections





Orthographic Projection




A series of flat (2D) views of an object showing it exactly as it is in shape and size i.e. constructional details.
An orthographic drawing shows all details and dimensions and is usually used as a production/working drawing.
 It is a convergent thinking style of drawing.
Orthographic drawings are produced at the final solution stage and are used as working drawings in the realization stage.

Sketching or freehand drawings


Are spontaneous representation of ideas on paper without the use of technical aids.
Designers use a range of freehand drawings in the early stages of developing ideas to explore shape and form (3D) and constructional details (2D).
Divergent thinking is prominent at this stage.

Annotations

Explain the thinking behind the visual image represented by the drawing.
They allow the designer to consider the implications of the ideas for further development.
Annotated drawings are an alternative form of expression of ideas that allows one to indicate links between the ideas.

Formal drawings.

Include: orthogonal, isometric, exploded isometric, sectional, parts and assembly drawings which are done with great precision and usually with mechanical drawing aides (ruler, square, compass) or in CAD programs (Autodesk Fusion).
Designers use these drawings at the realisation/development stage where the product is to be made. They are used to communicate to the manufacturer.
Convergent thinking is prominent at this stage.

Theory of Knowledge:
Are there aspects of the world that are not amenable to modeling?
 To what extent does graphical communication shape and limit our knowledge?3.3 Physical Modelling

Designers use physical models to visualize information about the context that the model represents. It is very common for physical models of large objects to be scaled down and smaller objects scaled up for ease of visualization. The primary goal of physical modelling is to test aspects of a product against user requirements. Thorough testing at the design development stage ensures that an appropriate product is developed.
Physical modelling not only allows designers to explore and test their ideas, but to also present them to others. Engaging clients, focus groups and experts to interact with physical models of products allows designers to gain valuable feedback that enable them to improve the design and product-user interface.

Scale Models
Term: A model that is either a smaller or larger physical copy of an object.
Scale models are:

accurate physical representations of objects or features of objects.
able to allow the design team, client or manufacturer visualise and/or manipulate (examine) the object.
scaled down or up keeping all sizes of the features in relation to each other.





Architecture Model

DNA Model





A scaled down model of a large object such as a building, car etc is used to gain a better understanding in the environment it will be in.
A full-sized building is modelled at greatly reduced scale.
This enables designers to visualise the structure of the building, external and internal lines and form.





A scaled up a small object such as a molecule or micro chip in order to be able to clearly visualise it as it is too small to normally see it.





Aesthetic models 
Term: A model developed to look and feel like the final product.

An aesethic/appearance prototype or appearance model is as its name suggests.
It does not function or operate in any way.
Aesthetic/appearance models are only concerned with form, color, style, texture and how the product fits in its visual environment.
They can be used for ergonomic testing, evaluating visual appeal, allow the non-designer to see and feel how the real product will be,  or production engineers collect data that will help them assess the feasibility for matching manufacturing systems.





Lotus Clay Aesthetic Model












It is usually made from clay, foam, rubber, plastic or wood.  For example, a simple model  it could solid pieces of foam that has been shaped and painted to look like the real thing or complex models that are like the real thing in weight, balance, materials and material properties.
Aesthetic models can be are expensive to produce (especially the complex ones) because of the life like surface finish but some are life sized like the car pictured. These models need to be handled carefully as they are not designed as working models, mock ups or prototypes.
Mock-ups 
Term: Mockups – A scale or full-size representation of a product used to gain feedback from users.

Mock-ups are used to test ideas and gather feedback from users.
They can be either full-scale or scaled models of products
They can have  some form of functionality, which means they could be considered a prototype as well.
A good example of how a design begins and gets to the mock up stage. It shows gathering of information to graphical and finally physical modelling.

Canon mock up – notice the lens mount and view finder
Prototypes 
Term: Prototypes – A sample or model built to test a concept or process, or to act as an object to be replicated or learned from. Prototypes can be developed at a range of fidelity and for different contexts.









Prototypes are to test and evaluate ideas.
A prototype can be a real working product made to real specifications that can be used throughout design development.
It has functionality unlike that of a mock-up (minimal) or lack of it in aesthetic models.
It is particularly useful in testing before production begins.
Prototypes help the development team discover and issues related to manufacturing the final product.
It also allows the development team to learn from the user through user feedback and user trials/interaction with the final prototype.

Prototype Fidelity
Term: Fidelity – The degree to which a prototype is exactly like the final product.
Prototypes can be made at varying levels of fidelity targeting a range of user and environment contexts. A combination of fidelity and user/environmental contexts allows for  deeper understanding of the ideas that aide design development. Better understanding of design fidelity.



Model Fidelity
Low Fidelity
Middle Fidelity
High Fidelity


Model Description

Not really tangible.
The user can offer input into the design idea.




Representation of aspects of the idea,  such as, a working mock-up with limited functionality.
This allows the user some interaction.




Mock-up of the idea, as close as possible to the final product, for example a full scale working prototype.
They are tangible and testable.
This allows full user interaction.




Context/Fidelity Level


restricted—in a controlled environment




general—any user, any environment
partial—final user or environment




total—final user and environment





Instrumented Models
Term: Instrumented Model – Prototypes that are equipped with the ability to take measurements to provide accurate quantitative feedback for analysis.

Instrumented physical models are equipped with the ability to take measurements to provide accurate quantitative feedback for analysis.
They can be used effectively to investigate many phenomena such as fluid flows in hydraulic systems or within wind tunnels, stress within structures and user interaction with a product. 
For example, an instrumented model of a keyboard can record the actions of the user and provide data on how often keys are used and the number of errors a user makes (that is, the number of times the backspace or delete key is used). 
These models can be scaled in terms of both geometry and important forces.

As technologies improve and the software becomes more powerful, so do the opportunities for designers to create new and exciting products, services and systems. Greater freedom in customization and personalization of products has a significant impact on the end user. The ability to virtually prototype, visualize and share designs enhances the whole design cycle from data analysis through to final designs.

The use of CAD to simulate the conditions in which a product will be used allows the designer to gain valuable data at low cost. For example, simulating the flow of air across a car exterior negates the need for a car and wind tunnel.

Surface and Solid Models







Surface Model

Solid Model




Term: Surface Modelling –  A realistic picture of the final model, offering some machining data. Surface models contain no data about the interior of the part. 
Term: Solid Modelling – Solid models are clear representations of the final part. They provide a complete set of data for the product to be realized.



Comparison of the differences between solid and surface modelling techniques.


Solid modelling techniques contain more information for the designer,


In order to produce a 3D model using CNC (computer numerical control) or RP (rapid prototyping) technologies


Surface modelling only has wall thickness.








Bottom-Up and Top-Down Modeling

Term: “Top down” design is a product development process obtained through 3D, parametric and associative CAD systems. The main feature of this new method is that the design originates as a concept and gradually evolves into a complete product consisting of components and sub-assemblies.

AutoDesk defintion

Term: “Bottom Up” – A designer creates part geometry independent of the assembly or any modelling other component. Although there are often some design criteria established before modelling the part, this information is not shared between models. Once all parts are completed, they are brought together for the first time in the assembly.

This allows for a database of parts that could be used elsewhere.
Is carried out by adding components to existing parts/bodies/components.





Bottom-Up

Top-Down






Data Modelling Including Statistical Modelling

Term: Is a model that determines the structure of data. 

Data modelling is based on the data requirements for an application.

Digital humans: motion capture, haptic technology, virtual reality (VR), and animation

Digital humans: 

are computer simulations of the biomechanics of the human body.
help to predict how a human (real) will react in a variety of situation or environments (places or locations).
Siemens has a great article on using digital humans in product design, manufacturing and so on











Discuss how digital humans can enhance human factors research.


Digital humans can be used to represent joint resistance, discomfort, reach envelopes and visual fields.


They can be used, for example, to measure the impact of clothing on human performance.


Haptic technology (also know as force feedback technology):

is an emerging technology that interfaces the user via the sense of touch.

How it works is by mechanical actuators apply forces to the user which gives them feedback.


By simulating the physics of the user’s virtual world, it is possible to compute these forces into real time. 


Haptic technology allows the user to become part of a computer simulation and to interact with it, enabling the designer to observe the user’s performance and to design a better outcome. 

It can be used in different environments particularly ones that are dangerous to humans, remote locations or in difficult locations to train in.

Haptic technology is employed in many gaming (home entertainment) consoles providing feedback such as the Wii Nintendo.

Virtual Reality – The ability to simulate a real situation on the screen and interact with it in a near-natural way.




https://youtu.be/BEFfp2QhHZU





Animation …The ability to link graphic screens together in such a way as to simulate motion or a process.

Motion capture … The recording of human and animal movement by any means, for example, by video, magnetic or electro-mechanical devices.
















Explain how motion capture is used to digitally represent motion.


A person wears a set of acoustic, inertial, LED, magnetic or reflective markers at each joint.


Sensors track the position of the markers as the person moves


 this produces a digital representation of motion.






Identify the advantages of motion capture for digitally representing motion.


Motion capture can reduce the cost of animation, which otherwise requires the animator to draw either each frame or key frames that are then interpolated.


Motion capture saves time and creates more natural movements than manual animation, but is limited to motions that are anatomically possible. Some applications, for example, animated super-hero martial arts, might require additional impossible movements.






Explain how motion capture contributes to the development of a digital human.


A motion capture session records the movements of the actor, not his or her visual appearance.


The captured movements are mapped to a 3D model (human, giant robot) created by a computer artist, to move the model in the same way.




How haptic technology, motion capture, VR and animation can be used to simulate design scenarios and contexts



Compare animation and virtual reality. – Refer to different design contexts. Consider costs, client needs and development time.


Describe haptic technology.- 


Also known as force feedback technology. Haptic technology works by using mechanical actuators to apply forces to the user. 


By simulating the physics of the user’s virtual world, it is possible to compute these forces into real time.




Explain how haptic technology and motion capture have enhanced design capability.- 


Haptic technology allows the user to become part of a computer simulation and to interact with it, enabling the designer to observe the user’s performance, so as to design a better outcome. 


Haptic technology can also be used in situations where it may prove difficult to train in the real environment. 


Haptic technology is also used in feedback devices used in home entertainment consoles. 


Motion capturing a number of users’ movements will allow designers to design better ergonomic products. 


Motion capture allows the designer to understand the users’ physiological requirements.

The growth in computing power has had a major impact on modelling with computer-aided manufacture. Rapid software and hardware developments allow new opportunities and exciting new technologies to create dynamic modelling of ever-greater complexity. Models can be simulated by designers using software, tested and trialled virtually before sending to a variety of peripheral machines for prototype manufacture in an ever-increasing range of materials. The ease of sending this digital data across continents for manufacture of prototypes has major implications for data and design protection.




The increasing effectiveness of rapid prototyping techniques in terms of both cost and speed enables designers to create complex physical models for testing.

The rapid pace of scientific discovery and new technologies has had a major impact on material science, giving designers many more materials from which to choose for their products. These new materials have given scope for “smart” new products or enhanced classic designs. Choosing the right material is a complex and difficult task with physical, aesthetic, mechanical and appropriate properties to consider. Environmental, moral and ethical issues surrounding choice of materials for use in any product, service or system also need to be considered.
Materials are often developed by materials engineers to have specific properties. The development of new materials allows designers to create new products, which solve old problems in new ways. For example, the explosion of plastic materials following the second world war enabled products to be made without using valuable metals.


Physical Properties
Mass
Term: Relates to the amount of matter that is contained with a specific material. It is often confused with weight understandably as we use Kg to measure it. Mass is a constant whereas weight may vary depending upon where it is being measured.
Weight
Term: Relies on mass and gravitational forces to provide measurable value. Weight is technically measure as a force, which is the Newton, i.e. a mass of 1 Kg is equivalent to 9.8 Newton [on earth].

Read the section on Mass from Wikipedia





Volume




Term: The quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a boundary, for example, the space that a substance solid, liquid, gas, or shape occupies or contains.

Strain
Term: The response of a material due to stress, defined as the change in length divided by the original length.
Young’s Modulus
Term: A measure of the stiffness of an elastic material and defined by stress/strain.
Stress/Strain Graph (Curve)

The elastic region is generally a straight line.
At the limit of proportionality it changes to a curved line  which becomes the plastic region.
Every material will perform differently under the application of stress and therefore each material’s graph will be different.
We can identify and collect considerable amounts of information from a Stress-Strain graph.
It is important when selecting materials.
Important to intensify features of the stress/strain curve.
Important to identify Stress/strain curve of various material groups.

Aesthetic Characteristics
Term: Aspects of a product that relate to taste, texture, smell and appearance.
Term: Aesthetic Appeal – Favourable in terms of appearance.

What determines aesthetic appeal is when a product is attractive to look at or pleasing to experience. It is through our senses.
Some aesthetic characteristics are only relevant to food, while others can be applied to more than one material group. 
Although these properties activate people’s senses, responses to them vary from one individual to another, and they are difficult to quantify scientifically, unlike the other properties.

Appearance: the design of appearance in a product must be aesthetically pleasing to attract a customer. unless it is for a certain market.

Colour: can be warm (e.g. browns) or cool (eg blues) can have psychological affects (e.g. greens are calming)
Shape: geometric or organic.














Properties of Smart Materials
Piezoelectricity

Piezoelectric materials give off a small electrical discharge when deformed.
When an electric current is passed through it, it increases in size (up to a 4% change in volume).
These materials are widely used as sensors in different environments.
 Piezoelectric materials can be used to measure the force of an impact, for example, in the airbag sensor on a car. The material senses the force of an impact on the car and sends an electric charge to activate the airbag.






Airbag system











Shape memory


Shape memory alloys (SMA) are metals that exhibit pseudo-elasticity and shape memory effect due to rearrangement of the molecules in the material.
 Pseudo-elasticity occurs without a change in temperature. The load on the SMA causes molecular rearrangement, which reverses when the load is decreased and the material springs back to its original shape. The shape memory effect allows severe deformation of a material, which can then be returned to its original shape by heating it.
Design contexts include frames of glasses, medical tools and antennas for mobile phones.

Robotic limbs (hands, arms and legs) use shape memory properties.. It is difficult to replicate even simple movements of the human body, for example, the gripping force required to handle different objects (eggs, pens, tools). 
SMAs are strong and compact and can be used to create smooth, lifelike movements. Computer control of timing and size of an electric current running through the SMA can control the movement of an artificial joint. 
Other design challenges for artificial joints include development of computer software to control artificial muscle systems, being able to create large enough movements and replicating the speed and accuracy of human reflexes.











Photochromicity

Photochromicity refers to a material that can described as having a reversible change of colour when exposed to light.
 A chemical either on the surface of the lens or embedded within the glass reacts to ultraviolet light, which causes it to change form and therefore its light absorption spectra.
Design contexts include: One of the most popular applications is for colour-changing sunglass lenses, which can darken as the sun brightens.


Magneto-rheostatic & Electro-rheostatic

 Electro-rheostatic (ER) and magneto-rheostatic (MR) materials are fluids that can undergo dramatic changes in their viscosity. 
They can change from a thick fluid to a solid in a fraction of a second when exposed to a magnetic (for MR materials) or electric (for ER materials) field, and the effect is reversed when the field is removed.
Design contexts include : 

MR fluids for use in car shock absorbers, damping washing machine vibration, prosthetic limbs, exercise equipment and surface polishing of machine parts. 
ER fluids have mainly been developed for use in clutches and valves, as well as engine mounts designed to reduce noise and vibration in vehicles.




Thermoelectricity

Thermoelectricity is, at its simplest, electricity produced directly from heat. It involves the joining of two dissimilar conductors that, when heated, produce a direct current.
Design contexts include: Thermoelectric circuits have been used in remote areas and space probes to power radio transmitters and receivers.

Overview of  Properties4.2 a Metals and Metallic Alloys













Typically hard and shiny with good electrical and thermal conductivity, metals are a very useful resource or the manufacturing industry. Most pure metals are either too soft, brittle or chemically reactive for practical use and so understanding how to manipulate these materials is vital to the success of any application.








Extracting metal from ore














Extraction takes place locally with added value often occurring in another country. (Int Mind). Australia has an abundance of Iron ore which is mined and then shipped to China and Japan where is it made into steel. Iron ore is 81 USD per tonne and Steel 672 per tonne in October 2014.










Grain size (Metals)
Metals are crystalline structures comprised of individual grains.





Grain Size

Grain Size




Zinc grains on galvanised iron

The grain size can vary and be determined by the heat treatment.
Reheating a solid metal or alloy allows the grains to change their structure.
Slow cooling forms larger grains
Rapid cooling (quench) forms smaller grains.
Directional properties can be formed by selectively cooling one area of the solid.
Grain size in metals can affect the properties:

tensile strength – coarse grains the stronger a metal
toughness – large or coarse grains the tougher the metal
ductility – coarse grains the more ductile a metal
brittleness – the smaller the grains the more brittle the metal
flexibility/malleability –  coarse grains the more malleable a metal
can affect density







Modifying physical properties
Alloying
Alloys are a mixture that contains at least one metal.

It can be two or more metals such as Bronze: Cu + Sn
It can be a metal and non metal  such as Carbon Steels: FE + C
Alloying and foreign atoms

Alloys compared to pure metals

Alloying increases strength and hardness
Alloying reduces malleability and ductility, of alloys compared to pure metals.
This is due to the presence of “foreign” atoms which interfere with the movements of atoms in the crystals during plastic deformation

Work hardening (Cold working or Strain Hardening)
Is the process of toughening the a metal through plastic deformation.
Metals work-harden after being plastically deformed, much like when you twist a soft drink can back and forward and then it get gets stiff and then eventually fails (breaks).


Tempering
Tempering is  a heat treatment process

Usually carried out after hardening of a metal to:

increase its toughness and ductility
decrease hardness and brittleness


Remember a hard material will have low toughness and vice versa.





Design criteria for super alloys
Superalloys: is an alloy that exhibits excellent mechanical strength, resistance to thermal creep deformation, good surface stability and resistance to corrosion.
Superalloys can be used at high temperatures, very close to their melting point. The strength of most metals decreases as the temperature increases.
Super alloys are used in Aerospace (e.g. rockets), Aviation (e.g. turbines), Chemical processing industry, nuclear reactors and much more.
Two criteria for super alloys are creep and oxidation resistance.
Creep

Creep is the tendency of a metal (or material) to slowly move or deform permanently due to the long term exposure of stress that are below the yield strength or ultimate strength of the metal. Creep is more severe when metals are subjected to near the melting point heat for long periods of time. (Wikipeadia 2007)

Oxidation resistance

Oxidation is the interaction between oxygen and different substances when they make contact, such as rust Fe2O3
Oxidation resistance is the ability of a material to resist the direct and indirect attack of oxygen (oxidation) and degradation.






Recovery and disposal
Of metals and metallic alloys

Metals and metallic alloys are so widely used.
They are easily recyclable
They can be indefinitely recycled
It can reduce the emissions and the affect on the environment
Reduce energy required to produce new metals

fro example up to 95%  energy savings in using recycled Aluminium.








Design Contexts

Ferrous Alloys contain iron (makes them magnetic). Non-ferrous contains no iron.

Where different metals and metallic alloys are used
Ferrous Alloys


Mild Steel – Carbon content of 0.1 to 0.3% and Iron content of 99.7 – 99.9%. Used for engineering purposes and in general, none specialised metal products.
Stainless Steel – Made up of Iron, nickel and chromium. Resists staining and corrosion and is therefore used for the likes of cutlery and surgical instrumentation.
Cast Iron – carbon 2 – 6% and Iron at 94 to 98%. Very strong but brittle. Used to manufacture items such as engine blocks and manhole covers.

Non-ferrous Alloys

Aluminium – An alloy of aluminium, copper and manganese. Very lightweight and easily worked. Used in aircraft manufacture, window frames and some kitchen ware. Pure Aluminium can be used in drink cans.
Copper – Copper is a natural occurring substance. The fact that it conducts heat and electricity means that it is used for wiring, tubing and pipe work.
Brass – A combination of copper and zinc, usually in the proportions of 65% to 35% respectively. Is used for ornamental purposes and within electrical fittings.
Silver – Mainly a natural substance, but mixing with copper creates sterling silver. Used for decorative impact in jewellery and ornaments, and also to solder different metals together.
Lead – Lead is a naturally occurring substance. It is heavy and very soft and is often used in roofing, in batteries and to make pipes. (from CastleMetalsEurope)

How meta grains grow.

Grain Growth4.2b Timber

Timber is a major building material that is renewable and uses the Sun’s energy to renew itself in a continuous cycle. While timber manufacture uses less energy and results in less air and water pollution than steel or concrete, consideration needs to be given to deforestation and the potential negative environmental impact the use of timber can have on communities and wildlife.










Structure of Natural Timber
Softwood and Hardwood Cell structure NB: you need to just be aware of the difference.

Natural timber is a natural composite material comprising cellulose fibres in a lignin matrix.

Moisture content of natural timber
When living trees are cut down the timber is of very little use in engineering, product design and so on. This is due to the moisture (or greenness) of the wood. Most of this moisture needs to be removed and a equilibrium moisture content achieved. In order to achieve this timber needs to be seasoned.

Absorbed moisture is the moisture contained in the cell walls of timber.
Free moisture is the moisture contained within the cell cavities and intercellular spaces.
Equilibrium Moisture content (EMC): This is when the moisture content of wood is at equilibrium (same as) the local environment. This can be affected by humidity and temperature changes.

Seasoning

Seasoning is the commercial drying of timber which reduces the moisture content of wood.
Thus making the timber highly useable.

Kiln seasoning is carried out in a thermally insulated chamber, a type of oven, that produce the appropriate temperatures to complete the processes, such as hardening, drying, or chemical changes.
Air-drying: Air- drying are stacks of sawn timber in the open or in large sheds. There is little control over the drying process as the weather elements have affects.
Kiln-drying are stacks of sawn timber in a kiln, to reduce the moisture content in wood, where the heat, air circulation, and humidity is closely controlled.







Kiln Seasoning

Timber Defects
While the moisture content of ‘wet’ timber is being removed defects may occur, some of which are listed below. Controlled seasoning can avoid this. However, once the EMC is achieve is timber goes from high humidity to low humidity (uncontrolled)  then the defects will occur.

Warping is the distortion in wood caused by uneven drying, which results in the material bending or twisting.
Bowing is the warping along the length of the face of the wood.
Cupping is the warping across the width of the face of wood, in which the edges are higher or lower than the centre.
Twisting is the warping where the two ends of a material do not lie on the same plane.
Knots are imperfections in timber, caused by the growth of branches in the tree that reduces its strength.





Timber Defects
















Natural timber
Is timber that is sawn from the tree and is used as is (ie not made into plywood, etc). This includes hardwood and softwood trees.











Hardwood trees

The wood from a deciduous (broadleaved) tree.
includes eucalyptus, elm, maple, oak, and beech.


Softwood trees





The wood from a coniferous (evergreen) tree.
includes are pine, cedar, and cypress









Eucalyptus Tree

Pine Tree



















Characteristics of natural timber

Tensile Strength: The tensile strength of natural timber is greater along the grain than across the grain.
Resistance to damp environments: is very resistant.
Longevity: Hardwoods very good. Softwoods good.
Aesthetic properties: natural colours range (red, purple, cream and brown). The grain can add to its aesthetics.



Grain Direction




Man-made timbers






Also known as Engineered board or composite wood
Man-made timber include:

Plywood (Laminated boards) are layers of veneers (very thin slices of wood) glued together perpendicularly.
Particle board (Chipboard) which is made from different sizes of wood chips, joined with glue and pressed.
MDF (Medium Density Fibre Board) strands of fibre ruled together and pressed into sheets.









Man-made timber often requires finishing such as painting or lamination.
Lamination is the covering the surface  with a thin sheet of another material (plastic laminate, wood veneer, etc) typically for protection, preservation or aesthetic reasons.







MDF

Particle Board

Plywood



Characteristics of man-made timber

Tensile strength: depends on the man-made timber

Plywood – high tensile strength in all directions
Particle board and MDF – very low


Resistance to damp environments: depends on the man-made timber.

Exterior plywood – excellent.
Interior plywoods very low
Particle board and MDF – very low


 Longevity:

Plywood is high
Particle board and MDF is low to medium


Aesthetic properties:

Plywood if the top layer is of a nice timber like Beech will be good
Particle board and MDF requires finishing or a sheet of lamination (see previous section)















Treating and finishing timbers

Treatment of wood can involve using solutions. The reasons for treating or finishing wood include:




Reducing attack by insects, fungus and marine borers by making the wood poisonous

Creosote: A material that penetrates the timber fibres protecting the integrity of the wood from attack from borer, wood lice and fungal attack.




Protection from the weather
Protection from Dry rot.
Where timber is subjected to decay and attack by fungus.
Improving chemical resistance
Enhancing aesthetic properties
Modifying other properties









Staining Timber

Insect Attack



Sanding/abrading








Recovery and disposal of timbers

Wood recycling is the process of turning waste timber into usable products.
Recycling timber is a practice that was popularized in the early 1990s as issues such as deforestation and climate change prompted both timber suppliers and consumers to turn to a more sustainable timber source.
Reforestation is the process of restoring tree cover to areas where woodlands or forest once existed. If this area never returns to its original state of vegetative cover the destructive process is called deforestation.

The rapid pace of technological discoveries isvery evident in the manufacture and use of glassin electronic devices. Different properties havebeen presented in glass for aesthetic or safety considerations for many years but the future of glass seems to be interactivity alongside electronic systems. Â The structure of glass is not well understood, butÂ as more is learned, its use is becoming increasingly prominent in building materials and structural applications.

Bendable Glass


Glass

The Story of glass, includes recycling and applications.
The Corning Museum of Glass
Glass is primarily composed fromÂ silca sand (silicon dioxide) together with limestone (calcium carbonate)Â and Soda Ash (sodium carbonate)Â and small quantities of a few other chemicals.
It takes a great amount of energy to produce glass from sand, melting point around 1700 Celsius so scrap glass is added. This makes recovery of glass important. Adding scrap glass makes the process more economical.















Characteristics of glass

Transparency, allows light to pass through thus allowing you to see the contents of a jar or through a window.
Colour, colour can de deigned in my adding chemicals
Strength â€“ low tensile strength but high compressive strength
Brittleness, it has a low impact strength and thus will shatter easily (low toughness).
Hardness, high hardness and wont scratch readily.
Un-reactivity â€“ is chemically inert so leaching of acid based contents is not a problem.
Non-Toxic due to its un-reactivity therefore suitable for food storage.
Non-porous, thus will hold liquids or stop moisture seeping from outside.
Insulator.
100% recyclable and is continuously recyclable

Applications


Soda Glass
Â This commercial glass and is the most commonly used. Has medium to low thermal shockÂ in other words it will shatter going from cold to hot or the other way.
Â Window panes, glassware, drink bottles, etc


Borosilicate (Pyrex)
Â Commonly know as Pyrex. The chemical composition Â of Soda Glass is altered by the addition of oxides which improve thermal conductivity.
Â Cookware, science equipment such as beakers, oven doors and anywhere where heat/cold are crucial to the design performance.


Toughened
Is heated up to the point of melting thenÂ blasted with cold air. This makes the outside is in compression and the slower cool interior is in tension. When it is impacted it shatters into little pieces rather than sharp shards.
Â Side windowsÂ of cars, shower glass or design contexts where there is a potential for impact.


Laminated
Â It is layers of glass and plastic sheets between them. When impacted the glass fragments are held in place.Â This prevents cracks from growing
Â Bullet proof glass,Â windscreens, bank teller windows,


Glass Fibre
Â Is very long strands of glass. Sometimes these are woven into mats and used as glass fibre reinforced plastic when combined with a resin (polymer).
Tent poles, fishing poles, Â car panels, swimming pools.

It reduces the energy required thus the costs in producing new glass.
When recycled the glass is separated into the same colours groups (due to chemical compounds) then are crushed .
Improves environmental concerns such as the extraction of raw materials, energy consumption, and reduced pollution.
It is continuously recyclable














Something Extra â€¦4.2d Plastics

Most plastics are produced from petrochemicals. Motivated by the finiteness of oil reserves and threat of global warming, bio-plastics are being developed. These plastics degrade upon exposure to sunlight, water or dampness, bacteria, enzymes, wind erosion and in some cases pest or insect attack, but in most cases this does not lead to full breakdown of the plastic. When selecting materials, designers must consider the moral, ethical and environmental implications of their decisions.
Early plastics used from 1600 BCE through to 1900 CE were rubber based. Prompted by the need for new materials following the first world war, the invention of Bakelite and polyethylene in the first half ofÂ the 20th century sparked a massive growth of plastic materials and as we identify the need for new materials with particular properties, the development of new plastics continues.

Development of Plastic









Early plastics were rubber based
After the 1st World War a need for new materials which led to the invention of Bakelite andÂ polyethylene.
WWII saw a need for new materials such as plastics, e.g. nylon to replace silk for parachutes.
Some uses of plastic during the war are now in everyday use.

Raw materials for plastics
From Technology Student

Technically plastics are referred to as Polymers
Petro-chemicals are the main ingredient for modern day plastics.
Roughly 8% of oil production is due in plastics
The raw material for plastics (mainly oil) is extracted in a country, exported to other countries where conversion to plastics takes place and these are re-exported at considerable added value. (Int Mind)
Bio-plastics â€“ such as polylactic acid (PLA) resin which is made from corn or potato starch â€“ is also biodegradable.

Thermosets not so easy (and expensive to do so)

need to be ground into a powder which adds time and costs.
Often get sent to landfill


Some plastics are not accepted at the recycling plant due to its chemical compound and the facilities capabilities.

Temperature and recycling thermoplastics
Result of heating plastic on the polymer chains

The Increase in temperature causes the weak secondary bonds to break (The heat is sufficient enough to break the secondary bonds but not the primary, covalent, bonds) see above image.
This allows the long molecular chains to slide over each other, i.e. be reshaped into a new product.
When a plastically deformed and allowed to cool it will remain in the new shape due to new secondary bonds being formed.
The nature of the structure of a thermoplastic allows it to be readily recycled.

Composites are an important material in an intensely competitive global market. New materials and technologies are being produced frequently forÂ the design and rapid manufacture of high-quality composite products. Composites are replacing more traditional materials as they can be created with properties specifically designed for the intended application. Carbon fibre has played an important part in weight reduction for vehicles and aircraft. (2.2)


What is a composite?











A mixture composed of two or more materials with one acting as the matrix (glue) the other acts as a reinforcement (fibres/sheet/particles).








Particle Board

Carbon Fibre Matting (sheet)




It takes the form ofÂ fibres/sheets/particles (reinforcement) in a matrix (glue).
The fibres/sheets/particles can be made from textiles, glass, plastics, wood and carbon.
The matrix can be made from thermoplastics, thermosetting plastics, ceramics (e.g. concrete), metals.
It is made via the process of weaving, moulding, pultrusion orÂ lamination

International-Mindedness
Many composite materials are expensive to produce and theirÂ dissemination globally is limited.4.3 Scale of Production





Decisions on scale of production are influenced by the volume or quantities required, types of materials used to make the products and the type of product being manufactured. There are also considerations of staffing, resources and finance.Â 




The growing phenomenon of mass customization brings consumers into the design process, allowing them to make choices that make a product unique, to make it their own. Companies have developed â€œdesign stationsâ€ in their retail stores where consumers can create virtual 3D models, â€œtry them outâ€ using digital technology and place their order.






ProductionÂ Systems









Craft production â€“ A small-scale production process centred on manual skills.
Mechanized production â€“ A volume production process involving machines controlled by Â humans.
Automated Production â€“ A volume production process involving machines controlled by production computers
See Productions systems for more details





Craft Production

Mechanized Weaving



Automated Production












Â One-off Production





Is an individual productÂ or a prototype for larger-scale production.
Products maybe made often with craft production techniques or a combination of craft and machines.
There is a close relationship between the manufacturer and consumer due to the user needs dominate.
If a prototype is made then it is usually part of the realisation of a product and so the next step after testing and evaluating would be batch or continuos flowÂ production.
Examples of products made include prototypes (e.g. car or clothing production), specialist models, hand crafted items (e.g. jewellery, shaker furniture), specialist engineering, specialist architecture (e.g. individual homes, skyscrapers, hotels like the Hydropolis) and just plain old one offs (e.g. Ocean liners).
With CAD/CAM (eg 3d Printing) one-off production can occur in the home.








Advantages

Highly customisable to consumers needs.
Flexibility for the designer and consumer.
Allow for testing of prototypes before continuous flow production.

Disadvantages

Can be expensive as any tools or machinery needed are included in the final cost.
Time consuming if craft manufacturing techniques are used
Â May be that the product is not designed for disassembly (DfD) there are no interchangeable parts.




Specialist Guitar

Shaker Furniture



Batch Production

It is a limited production run (a set number of items to be produced).
Batch production is a manufacturing method used to produce or process any product in batches, as opposed to a continuous production process, or an one-off production.
Batch production is popular in bakeries and in the manufacture of sports shoes, pharmaceutical ingredients, inks, paints and adhesives.
Can be mechanised or automated production

Greater consumer choice and product differentiation
Advantages

Cheaper than one-off production (economies of scale).
Customisable products but not as highly as one-off production.
Easily adjust to market demands or seasonal Â items
Greater consumer choice (e.g. Swatch watches).
For smaller or upstart companies that canâ€™t affordÂ continuous flow production.
Â It can reduce initial capital outlay because a single production line can be used to produce several products.

Disadvantages

Down time between productions runs when retooling.
Products have to be stored raising the costs per item.

Mass Production

The production of large amounts of standardized products on production lines, permitting very high rates of production perÂ worker.
Used when large quantities of products are needed such cars, bic pens etc

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UjUWfwWAC4
Continuous Flow Production

ContinuousÂ flow is aÂ production method used to manufacture, produce or process materials without interruption.
Is where thousands of standardisedÂ products are continuously made 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
It is carried outÂ to maximise production while reducing theÂ costs of starting and stopping the production process.
It can be mechanised orÂ automated process with only a handful of workers needed.

Advantages

Cheaper than other production methodsÂ (economies of scale).
If a part or product needs replacing consumer is assured that it still exists (e.g. bic pens).
Lack of inventory which reduces storage costs.

Disadvantages

Standard products so less choice for the consumer.
Automated production is high in initial costs
Training of staff to run machines and CIM

Mass customization

Â A Â CIM system that manufactures products to individual customer needs or wants.
It benefits fromÂ Â economy of scale for a single products or thousands of them.
The relationship between the manufacturer and customer becomes closer because the individual requirements of the consumer dominate.

Something Extra â€¦4.4 Manufacturing Processess

Designers sometimes engineer products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture. Design for manufacture (DfM) exists in almost all engineering disciplines, but differs greatly depending on the manufacturing technologies used. This practice not only focuses on the design of a productâ€™s components, but also onÂ quality control and assurance.Â 








Advancements in 3D printing have resulted in the ability to have a 3D printer at home. Consumers can download plans for products from the internet and print these products themselves.



Design for manufacture (DfM)














Design for manufacture â€“ Designers design specifically for optimum use of existing manufacturing capability.
Therefore if a company has injection moulders available then the designer designsÂ the product with that manufacturing machine in mind â€“ i.e. considers the material needed (thermoplastic) and its related properties and workability.





Additive Techniques



Are manufacturing techniques that add material in order to createÂ a product or component.
3D printing has rapidly advanced and become affordable which has resulted in the ability to have a 3D printers at home.

Consumers can download plans for products from the internet and print these products themselves.
Simple CAD software is more understandable these days so consumers can design and print custom parts.

Something Extra â€¦4.5 Production Systems





As a business grows in size and produces more units of output, then it will aim to experience falling average costs of productionâ€”economies of scale. The business is becoming more efficient in its use of Â inputs to produce a given level of output. Designers should incorporate internal and external economies of scale when considering different production methods and systems for manufacture.




The design of a production system requires a complete understanding of a product, its function and the quality of finish. Each system can be unique and specific to the product it is creating, often requiring the designers to adapt their design to be manufactured using certain methods.





Â Craft production




Â A production process that based onÂ manual skills. It is aÂ small-scale production.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCJ7IgPq7PA&t=15s










Advantages and disadvantages of craft production.

WhenÂ discussingÂ advantagesÂ andÂ disadvantages, students should consider economies of scale, value of the product, labour, market forces and flexibility of manufacture.








Advantages
Disadvantages


Economies of scale



Craft production it is not possible to produce on a larger scale.
This could mean a loss of profit for the manufacturer
however the higher prices of craft produced products can sometimes make up for this.
Price is higher as labour, tools, etc have to incorporated in the final cost.




Value of the product



Â Although the manufacturing process doe not require machines for the producer,
It takes a great amount of time and effort
Therefore it becomes much more expensive for the buyer.
Every piece also becomes more valuable so any defects will be more important.




Labour


Â Much skill is often required for the craftsman
Therefore they are able to charge more for the manufacturing of the product.




Â It takes a great amount of time and effort
Slower than mechanized production.




Market forces


Â A lot more care is put into making the product as good/nice as possible,
Therefore the quality tends to be seen as considerably higher than something that was mass-produced





Flexibility of manufacture


Â The product can also be customised to fit personal needs
There is a good deal of flexibility for the designer, customer and craftsman.




May be that the product is not designed for disassembly,
so if something goes wrong during the making of it, there are no interchangeable parts.
Therefore it becomes much more expensive for the buyer.








Design ContextsÂ include: one-off products such as custom made furniture, pottery, art and crafts,
Mechanized production
A volume production process where machines are controlled by humans.

Originally, very small numbers of products were made by craftsmen in home workshops.

Assembly line production
A volume production process where products and components are moved continuously along a conveyor. As the product goes from one work station to another, components are added until the final product is assembled.
The mass production of a product via a flow line based on the inter-changeability of parts, pre-processing of materials, standardisation and work division.
The use of an assembly line for manufacturing a product is a manufacturing technique where the product in question is moved from one modification stand to another by a mechanically moving conveyor. It is used to gather in a fast way large amounts of uniform products. The origins of the Assembly line can be traced back to 1908, when Henry Ford invented and used for the first time the assembly line for the manufacturing of his Ford Model T.

Theory of Knowledge






The increased dependency on automation and robots has affected craftsmanship. How has technology affected traditional ways of knowing?4.6 Robots in Automated Production









Designers should consider the benefits of increased efficiency and consistency when using robots in production and be able to explore the latest advances in technology to ensure the optimum manufacturing process is used. However, a good designer will also understand their responsibility to consider the moral and ethical issues surrounding increased use of automation, and the historical impact of lost jobs.
TheÂ introduction of robots to anÂ assemblyÂ lines had aÂ major impact on the labour force, often making skilled workers redundant in favour of aÂ technician who canÂ maintainedÂ equip a large numberÂ of robots.














Primary characteristics of robots:

Work envelope: The 3D space a robot can operate within, considering clearance and reach
Load capacity: Within this context, the weight a robot can manipulate.


Single-task robots â€“ can only carry out one task at a time
Multi-task robots â€“ can carry out more than one task at a time
Teams of robots â€“ groups of robots carry out similar tasks
Teams
Machine to machine (M2M) Â â€“ where wireless and wired systems communicate between devices to share information or send instructions.Â More information here.

Advantages of using robotic systems in production.

Improve health and safety of workforce.
High accuracy of work â€“ reduced errors and waste ($$$). Quality of final product is up.
Perform repetitive and dangerous tasks
Work in confined spaces.
Perform functions 24/7 leading to higher production

Disadvantages of using robotic systems in production

Expertise needed to operate such systems.
Training of workers required in both operation and maintenance.
High initial capital cost

Â Robot Generations
This robotee summaries it well

First-generation robotsÂ are a simple mechanical arm that has the ability to make precise motions at high speed. They need constant supervision by a human operator.
Second-generation robotsÂ are equipped with sensors that can provide information about their surroundings. They can synchronize with each other and do not require constant supervision by a human; however, they are controlled by an external control unit.
Third-generation robotsÂ are autonomous and can operate largely without supervision from a human. They have their own central control unit. Swarms of smaller autonomous robots also fit in this category.


They are not industrial but it does illustrate the autonomous interactions with their environment.
When addressing robots in automated production, students are expected to understand the contexts that different robots are used in.

International-mindedness:
The use of robots in automated production can depend on the local cost of manual labour.
Theory of knowledge:
Technology in the form of robots currently serves man. Is manâ€™s place secure? Will the nature of man change due to technological enhancement? Will he be superseded altogether by technological developments?5.1 Invention





Invention by lone inventors or in collaborative, creative teams is at the forefront of design. Designers must not only be creative and innovative, but also understand the concepts that will make a new product viable. A designer must use imaginationÂ and be firmly grounded in factual and procedural knowledge while remembering the needs and limitations of the end user.




Inventions are often the result of an individual or groupâ€™s curiosity about whether something can be done or a problem can be solved. On occasion, inventions are the result of an individualâ€™s curiosity about something other than the product that they finally develop. These inventions include microwave ovens, ink-jet printers and Post-itÂ® notes.






Term: Invention â€“ is the process of discovering a principleÂ which allows aÂ technical advance in a particular field that resultsÂ in a novel/new product.

Motivators for Invention




Â Term: Drivers for Invention â€“These include personal motivation to express creativity/for personal interest, scientific or technical curiosity, constructive discontent,Â desire to make money, desire to help others.

Personal motivation to invent.

It could be out of personal interest (a tinkerer) or creative expression.


To assist people and make life better.

Like Mick Ebeling in the video above.
Bayliss and his spring driven radio for Africa (Powerhouse Collection)


Constructive discontent.

The advantages and disadvantages of being a lone inventor



Advantages
Disadvantages


Full control over the development of their invention.
Lack business acumen.


Driven:Â Â with a goal of the complete invention of a new and somewhat revolutionary product.
May not comprehend or give sufficient care to the marketing and sales of there product.


Have ideas that are completely new and different.
Their ideas, because of how different they are are often resisted by other employees and workers.



Are having a harder time to push forward their designs, especially in a market where large investments are required for success.



Are usually isolated, and have no backing towards their design.



Trouble working in teams because of their emotional attraction to their invention.







Intellectual Property (IP)




Term: IP â€“ A legal term for intangible property such as â€œcreations of the mindâ€ such as inventions and designs that are used in a commercial setting. Intellectual property is protected by law.

This include inventions, designs, art, music, literature, etc.
Open University explains IP and Patents





IP

IP
















The benefits ofÂ intellectual propertyÂ include:Â 

differentiating a business from competitors
allowing sale or licensing, providing an important revenue stream
offering customers something new and different
marketing/branding
establishing a valuable asset that can be used as security for loans.

Strategies for Protecting IP




IP Symbols






Term: Patents â€“Â Â An agreement from a government office to give someone the right to make or sell a new invention for a certain number of years.




Term: Trademark, Â®, or, TM â€“ Â A trademark is a symbol, word, or words legally registered or established by use as representing a company or product.




Term: Design protection â€“Â A simple and cost-effective way to protect an innovative shape, appearance or ornamentation.
Term: Â Copyright,Â Â©Â Â â€“Â A legal right that grants the creator of an original work exclusive ownership for its use and distribution. Usually for a limited time andÂ within geographical boundaries, copyright allows the creator to receive compensation for their intellectual effort.
Term: Service Mark (SM) â€“ Â A trademark used to identify a service rather than a product.
Term: Patent Pending â€“ An indication that an application for a patent has been applied for but has not yet been processed. The marking serves to notify those copying the invention that they may be liable for damages (including back-dated royalties), once a patent is issued.
Look at these two topics regarding IP.

First to Market
Term: First to Market â€“ The first product of this type to be rushed onto the market.

When a company or a person has or think they have an innovative idea orÂ product, therefore, will rush to have it onto the market before anyone else.
Open University read on Clive Sinclairâ€™s company â€“ pocket calculators, 1980 computer (hooked up to the TV and used a tape).
â€œFirst product that created a new market (such as the desktop computer), a product category (such as the portable computer), or a substantial subdivision of a category (such as the laptop or handheld computer)â€.Â Business Dictionary definition.
Appleâ€™s Patents:Â they protect every idea that comes across a desk even if it is never intended to be used soon.
Ten First to Market losers!





Saehan and Rio MP3 players

Apple Newton â€“ the first PDA



Advantages of Being First to Market





Leading the competition

before competitors develop rival products
to gain a larger market share


Increased profit

as the product is the first of its type to be released on the market
allowing the company to capture a large market share


Secure brand loyalty

ensuring that consumers are more likely to purchase the iPad
so the product becomes the dominant design


Secure IP

prevent competitors from developing similar productsïƒ¼enabling
the iPad to become the dominant design


Creating a new product category

that creates a new market
that allows Apple to become a market leader







Shelved Technologies
Term: Technology that is shelved for various reasons. Sometimes shelved technologies will be rediscovered or taken off the shelf.
Reasons for shelving technology include:

Social.

Market is not yet ready for change.
Examples, smart glasses, Â self driving cars or collision avoidance technology


Technology.

Is not resolved sufficiently to introduce the product. In other words the science behind the technology exists but making it into Â viable product does not.
Examples, smart glasses, flexible phones (flexible glass has been around a while), touch screen smart phones.


Timing.

Products are introduced in a strategic order.
To improve market viability â€“ gain


Cost/Price.

Product is not released until the technology becomes affordable.
Often new technology or products are expensive (first iPhone) Â therefore there may not be a market (consumers not willing to spend the money â€“ ie value for money)

International Mindedness






The role of intellectual property and patents in stifling or promoting inventions globally needs to be considered, especially with regard to the inequalities between countries.





Theory of Knowledge






What is the role of imagination in invention? Are there limits to what can be imagined?




Sometimes there are unforeseen consequences of inventions. To what extent might lack of knowledge be an excuse for unethical conduct?











Something Extra â€¦

Â Not all companies that come up with great inventions are good innovators, take Xeroxâ€™sÂ PARCÂ research centre for example, they invented personal computers and the GUI interface long before Apple Inc. In fact Apple bought the GUI from them and made into what it is today! The XeroxÂ star.
BBC Jeremy Clarkson â€“ Inventions That Changed the World on Youtube.5.2 Innovation





Designers will be successful in the marketplace when they solve long-standing problems, improve on existing solutions or find a â€œproduct gapâ€. The constant evaluation and redevelopment of products is key,Â with unbiased analysis of consumers and commercial opportunities.




In order for an invention to become an innovation, the idea of the product needs to be effectively communicated. The communication can take many forms and be between many stakeholders.





Â Invention and Innovation
Thank you! Â to The Open University for their content on Invention and Innovation
Term: Innovation â€“Â the business of putting an invention in the marketplace and making it a success.

It is making an invention/s useful and successfully entering it into the marketplace.

A microchip is a wonderful invention, on its own it is useless but in a computer system it is awesome!
Apple iPhone used many inventions to make it a successful product in the market place, including iTunes, touch screens, etc (all of which were inventions)

Activity:

Few Inventions Become Successful Â Innovations due to the Following Reasons:

Marketability

Low product demand or not readily saleable


Financial support

There is little monetary backing from the organisation or an outsider.
The invention would need more sponsors to financially aid the product.


Marketing

Is the process of getting products from the producer or vendor to the consumer or buyer, which includes advertising, shipping, storing, and selling. Poor marketing strategies or wrong target markets.
Invention would need to be advertised as a product the public would want.
TrendsÂ in innovation.


The need for the invention

Examples include alternative energy resources to combat our insatiable need for oil however if oil prices are low or there is a ready supply of oil then the alternative energy invention will not take hold.


Price

Affordable, cost effectiveness or value for money â€¦ therefore it may be too expensive to purchase, or to manufacture and the consumer may not see it worth its cost compared to its use.
Keep in mind, the productâ€™s price needs to be equivalent to the income of the specific age group that would buy the majority of the product.


Resistance to change

People and organisations can be resistant and reluctant to change, feeling comfort and security in the familiar thus resist new ideas/products.


Aversion to risk

â€œRisk aversion is a concept in economics, finance, and psychology related to the behaviour of consumers and investors under uncertaintyâ€. (en.wikipedia.org 2007)



Being successful at innovation â€¦

ArticleÂ from Innovation tools









Categories of Innovation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbPiAzzGap0
Open University explains sustaining and disruptiveÂ as well as process innovation.
Term: Sustaining innovation â€“ Â A new or improved product that meets the needs of consumers and sustains manufacturers.

Examples include the wheel and iPhone where 2nd, 3rd â€¦ 6th generations/versions of the product have been developed.



Term: Disruptive innovation â€“ Â A product or type of technology that challenges existing companies to ignore or embrace technical change





Examples include the iPod which changed the way we managed and Â listened to music. Mobile phones so we were no longer restricted to landlines.
Ipods/Iphones are disruptive





Term: Process innovation â€“ Â An improvement in the organization and/or method of manufacture that often leads to reduced costs or benefits to consumers.

Example is in the automobile industry such as Ford Â with the introduction of assembly line production and Toyota with leanÂ manufacturing.

Robots in car manufacture

Activity: Students will need to be able to draw from examples of each category of innovation.

Innovation Strategies for Design
Term: Architectural innovation â€“Â The technology of the components stays the same, but the configuration of the components is changed to produce a new design.



Putting existing components together in novel ways.
Examples include: electric cars, Sony Walkman.











1970s Sony Walkman.
Panasonic Slim Portable Cassette player.
The Crosley (retro-styling) tape deck.



Term:Â Modular innovation â€“ Â The basic configuration stays the same, but one or more key components are changed.



Making an existing comment better
Examples include a new type of petrol filter, Youtube Â or Facebook.
The Googleâ€™s Project AraÂ â€“ new dream phone



Term: Configurational innovation â€“ Â A change is made in both technology and organization.
A Â great read!

Two students project.


Activity: Examples where innovation strategies have been used for products

Innovation Strategies for Markets
Term: Diffusion â€“ Â is a process where a market will accept a new idea or product. The rate it accepts the new idea or product can be increased by several factors.



A goodÂ articleÂ from USC in the US
Examples of widely diffused products include the, light bulb, Â refrigerator (100%), ATM cards, Music CDâ€™s (now mp4 format).
Once widely accepted they often become dominant designs.
ATM cards widely diffused.



Term: Suppression â€“ Â is a process where a new idea or adoption of a product by the market is actively slowed. This may be due to difficulties competing with a dominant design, ambiguity over patent ownership, competing companies actively petitioning against a new product it perceives as threatening, or the natural resistance to an unfamiliar concept.



Diffusion vs Suppression from Open University
Examples include the telephone (land line) when it had to compete with the firmly established (dominate design) of theÂ telegraph(y).




Activity:Â Examples where innovation strategies have been used for products



International Mindedness
Â Innovations may have positive consequences in some countries/regions and negative ones in others.




Theory of knowledge
Design is always looking to the future and new development. Do other areas of knowledge have universal, timeless truths or are they continually in flux?5.3 Strategies for Innovation





Companies encourage advancements in technology and services, usually by investing in research and development (R&D) activities. Even though the R&D may be carried out by a range of different experts from varied fields of research, the development process is often based on common principles and strategies to identify the direction of development. This methodology structures the R&D of new technologies and services.




Innovation should always occur in context and a deep understanding of the culture as well as the behaviours, needs and wants of the consumer is required.









Act of Insight
Term: Often referred to as the â€œeureka momentâ€, a sudden image of a potential solution is formed in the mind, usually after a period of thinking about a problem.

Open University on Act of InsightÂ 
Such as Newton watching an apple fall and gaining insight in gravitation forces. DaVinci inventing a crane after watching workers trying to lift heavy stone from a boat.

Technology Transfer
Term: Technological advances that form the basis of new designs may be applied to the development of different types of products/systems, for example, laser technology.

Open University on Transfer
Laser transferred into surgery or audio or data CDs





Laser beam welding


Laser Pointer




Analogy
Term: An idea from one context is used to stimulate ideas for solving a problem in another context.

Open University on Analogy
Sonar modelled on how bats navigate.





Echolocation


Sonar â€“ checking for depth or fish




Chance
Term: An unexpected discovery leads to a new idea.

Market Pull
Term: A new idea is needed as a result of demand from the marketplace.

Open University onÂ Mark Pull
The car market which has separate segments for the supermini, family cars,Â mini-vans, executive cars, sports cars, SUV, and so on.


Activity: Â Describe one design context for each of the strategies listed above where they have been applied.





Theory of knowledge
Design is continually changing due to its openness to new ideas. Do other areas of knowledge recognize new influences to the same extent?









Something Extra â€¦
â€œTechnologyâ€ PushÂ approaches:

Typified by programs, but not necessarily software programs
Internal development comes up with a patent or a technological device to fulfill the need of a customer
Has high market related risk because application is not known
Has low technology related risk because application is known
Innovation is created, then appropriate applications are sought to fit the innovation
Did the market ask â€œplease give me an iPod with download storeâ€ or a camera phone? Most likely not; so this would be a technology push,.

â€œMarketâ€ PullÂ approaches:

Implemented on platforms
Platforms are open ended and can evolve based on changing needs
Has low market related risk because application is known
Has low technology related risk because solution is not known
When the market asks for better safety features in a car then this would be market pull.

Open University lesson on Invention and Innovation5.4 Stakeholders in invention and innovation

Collaborative generation of knowledge and high efficiency information flow allow for diversity, increased resilience, reliability and stability within an organization. Through participatory research, stakeholders can make full use of the resulting innovation and invention, by transferring findings relevant to the sector in which they are positioned. A designerâ€™s increased awareness through shared industry knowledge enhances profitability and policy.




On occasion, the inventor needs to act as both entrepreneur and product champion. The adoption of these additional roles requires a significant amount of learning to take an idea from the mind, realize it and then diffuse it successfully into the marketplace.









Â The Inventor, The Product Champion, The Entrepreneur
Term: The Lone Inventor â€“is an individual working outside or inside an organization who is committed to the invention of a novel product and often becomes isolated because he or she is engrossed with ideas that imply change and are resisted by others.

The 2 Steves


Steve Jobs the Movie is biography that Steve Wozniak says is pretty accurate.

Original 1976 Apple 1 computer


A part of the whole story tells of how the two Steves started Apple. How Steve Wozniak (the inventor) was the tinkerer, inventor and gadget maker. Steve Jobs (product champion) saw a potential in Wozâ€™s inventions. Noether of them had any money. Jobs Â went to a local computer store owner (the entrepreneur)Â to secure financial backing to build (in the basement of his home) and sell their computers.

ComparisonÂ Between Lone Inventor and Product champion

The lone inventor may lack the business acumen to push the invention through to innovation.
The product champion is often a forceful personality with much influence in a company.
The product champion may not be the inventor.
He or she is more astute at being able to push the idea forward through the various business channels and is often able to consider the merits of the invention more objectively.

Â The Inventor as a Product Champion and/or Entrepreneur
Sometimes aninventormay have developed skills or profiles of a Â product champion and/or entrepreneur.
James Dyson and Thomas Edison are two examples.

Edison (later it was discovered that Swan invented the light bulb) used profits from his earlier inventions to bring the light bulb to market.
15 inventions that changed the world from Edison â€“Â Business Insider
James Dyson is an example of an inventor,Â product champion and/or entrepreneur. He invented the cyclone technology for suction. At first no-one was interested in this radical design so he â€˜championedâ€™ his product until he found a Japanese company would would take it on. Later he would use the profits to further improvements and novel products. He build an understanding of business.
An article on Dyson

Inventors often take the role of product champion and/or entrepreneur because â€¦

Their product or idea is novel
Too novel or â€˜out thereâ€™ for a company to take a risk on
Cant find a backer or company to produce it
The inventor will have to â€˜championâ€™ their product to different companies

Dyson ball-barrow â€“ Click fo 10 of Dysonsâ€™ machines



A Multidisciplinary Approach to Innovation
On occasion, the inventor is also the product champion and/or entrepreneur.





This requires specific skill sets and actions to fulfil these roles and the reason inventors often take on multiple roles.
 Effective design draws from multiple areas of expertise, and this can be utilised at different stages of product development.
Most products are now extremely complex and rely on expertise from various disciplines. Most designs are developed by multidisciplinary teams.

Modern Products such as smart-phones, printer/scanners are very complex.
Requires knowledge from many disciplines.


It would be unlikely that a lone inventor would have the expertise in all the disciplines.

Most modern day designs are developed inÂ multidisciplinary teams







Advantages and Disadvantages of a Multidisciplinary Approach to Innovation.




Advantages
Disadvantages




Â wide range of knowledgeÂ that others may not have considered

individual may not be use to working in teams
different working styles and speed
chance of miscommunication






Activity: Find and explain how a product or innovation wasÂ developed inÂ multidisciplinary teams.

Myth of a Lone Inventor5.5 Product life cycle






Designers need to consider the whole productÂ cycle of potential products, services and systems throughout the design cycle and beyond. Products may have an impact not only on the direct consumer but also on society at large and the environment.




An understanding of the product life cycle allows the designer to design a product with obsolescence in mind. Doing this at the design stage can potentially eliminate the effect of a product on the environment when it is no longer in use.





Product Life Cycle
Term: Is aÂ tool for mapping out the four stages of a productâ€™s commercial life: Launch; Growth; Maturity; Decline.








Product :Life Cycle Chart

IB Product Life Cycle Chart



Â Key Stages of The Product Life Cycle

Launch:Â There are slow sales and little profit as the product is launched on the market.
Growth:Â The market gradually accepts the product, so diffusion starts and sales expand.
Maturity:Â Sales peak but remain steady, so maximum profit is achieved.
Decline:Â Market saturation is reached and sales start to reduce as well as profit.

Obsolescence

More longer version is on youtube.
Obsolescence Affects The Product Life Cycle.
Obsolescence isÂ where a product or trend becomes obsolete or outdated and no longer used or needed.

Reason why for many products the product cycle has shortened.

include new safety features.
include latest technology.
trends in fashion or style fluctuate.
ensure a continuing market.


IB has identified 4 types of obsolescence.

Term: Planned Obsolescence â€“Â A product becomes outdated as a conscious act either to ensure a continuing market or to ensure that safety factors and new technologies can be incorporated into later versions of the product.
Term: Style (fashion) Obsolescence â€“Â Â Fashions and trends change over time, which can result in a product no longer being desirable. However, as evidenced by the concept of retro styling and the cyclic nature of fashion, products can become desirable again.
Term: Functional Obsolescence â€“Â Â Over time, products wear out and break down. If parts are no longer available, the product can no longer work in the way it originally did. Also, if a service vital to its functioning is no longer available, it can become obsolete.
Term: Technological Obsolescence â€“Â Â When a new technology supersedes an existing technology, the existing technology quickly falls out of use and is no longer incorporated into new products. Consumers instead opt for the newer, more efficient technology in their products.




Planned â€“ Light bulbs â€“ are planned to last a certain mount of hours. Read More.









Activity:Â Find oneÂ example of a product for each of the types of Â obsolescence.
Activity: Identify and describe one product (other than computers, phones, tablets or MP3 players) that have a shortened product cycle.
Â Activity:Â Compare a laptop computer and a ballpoint pen.

Laptop computers are an intensely competitive market, with size and power being key issues. Whereas ball point pens meet the needs of the target market and still sell strongly.


Predictability of The Product Life Cycle

Length of the product life cycle considering the effect of technical development
Length of the product life cycle considering the effect of consumer trends including fashion â€“ unpredictable
Planned is predictable

Product Versioning/Generations
ProductÂ Versioning is Â offering a range of products based on a core or initial product market segments.
A company can maintain a pioneering strategy and consistent revenue flow by introducing new versions or generations of a product to a market. Apple uses this strategy effectively, creating multiple versions and generations of their iPodÂ®, iPhoneÂ® and iPadÂ® products.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2KLyYKJGk05.6 Rogersâ€™ characteristics of innovation and consumers





Rogersâ€™ four main elements that influence the spread of new ideas (innovation, communication channels, time and a social system) rely heavily on human capital. The ideas must be widely accepted in order to be self- sustainable. Designers must consider various cultures and communities to predict how, why and at what rate new ideas and technology will be adopted.
By categorizing consumers, the designer can identify particular segments with a market sector to gain feedback. By engaging with these stereotypes, the designer can utilize their experiences with a prototype in order to guide further development.





Diffusion and innovation
Diffusion is Â the wide acceptance and sale of a product or innovation.
Â 

A good article from PSU
The impact of Rogersâ€™ characteristics on consumer adoption of an innovation
Â 
Rogersâ€™ Characteristics from the Open University
The impact of Rogersâ€™ characteristics on consumer adoption of an innovation can be considered in terms of:

Relative advantage â€“ is the Â â€œthe degree to which the innovation is perceived as better than the idea it supersedes. Relative advantage refers to the extent to which the innovation is more productive, efficient, costs less, or improves in some other manner upon existing practicesâ€.

An example on the Open Uni


Compatibility â€“ is â€˜the degree to which the innovation is perceived as being consistent with existing values, past experiences, and needs of potential adopters. Â An innovation must be considered socially acceptable to be implemented. And some innovations require much time and discussion before they become socially acceptableâ€™.

An example on theÂ Open UniÂ â€“ the mobile phone.


Complexity (simplicity) â€“ is â€œtheÂ degree to which the innovation is perceived as difficult to understand and useâ€.

An example on theÂ Open UniÂ â€“ GUI (Graphic User Interface) of the Apple computers allowing users to pint and click and what they can see.


Observability â€“ is â€œthe degree to which the results of the innovation are visible to others.Â The chances of adoption are greater if folks can easily observe relative advantages of the new technology. In fact, after some adopt, observability can improve the diffusion effect, a critical component of technology transferâ€.

An example on theÂ Open UniÂ â€“ Solar panels on roofs.


Trialability â€“ is â€œthe degree to which the innovation may be experimented with on a limited basis.Â Innovations are easier to adopt if they can be tried out in part, on a temporary basis, or easily dispensed with after trialâ€.

An example on theÂ Open UniÂ â€“ test driving a car.



Quoted fromÂ http://www.soc.iastate.edu/sapp/soc415Diffusion1.html
â€œIn general, innovations that are perceived as having relative advantages, being more compatible, less complex, observable, and trialable will diffuse more rapidly than other innovations.In general, innovations that are perceived as having relative advantages, being more compatible, less complex, observable, and trialable will diffuse more rapidly than other innovations.â€ â€“ Open Uni

The influence of social media on the diffusion of innovation
Â 
Consumers can influence diffusion of innovation. When considering the influence of social media in rallying support for boycotting of some products/systems, students can explore the concepts behind organizations such as Kickstarter, Sellaband, Seedrs and CrowdCube, which act as crowd-funding platforms for creative products and projects. They can also examine the role of social networks such as FacebookÂ®, LinkedInÂ® and TwitterÂ® as methods of raising brand awareness.

A classic design is not simply defined by how well it functions or its impact. Classic designs can be recognized as from their design movement/era. Yet, originalityâ€” whether it is evolutionary or revolutionaryâ€”seems to be the trait that makes a product â€œtimelessâ€.The iconic status of classic designs is oftenÂ attributed to them beingÂ â€˜breakthrough productsâ€™.

Term: Design Classic â€“Â A product that serves as a standard of its time, that has been manufactured industrially and has timeless appeal.

Regardless in what year or time period it still remains at a high standard.
A classic design is instantly recognisable and will provoke
Vespa 98 â€“ Visit the History of the Vespa
different emotional responses.

These could include:Â desire to need or want it, â€˜wowâ€™ factor (innovation), nostalgia, â€˜likeâ€™ or â€˜hateâ€™, etc


Often referred to as â€œiconicâ€, 

the longevity of classic designs suggests quality,
Leviâ€™s 501 Visit the history of Leviâ€™s
 the continued demand for such products is not dependent on heavy marketing or advertising,Â 
 although this often takes place to reinforce the status and remind new generations of consumers of the intrinsic value of the classic design.




The design is often widely imitated, usually with cheaper versions, 

so this reinforces the status of the original design and its â€œpioneeringâ€ concept. Â 


The classic design may no longer be needed as a functional object or it may become technologically obsolete. 

However, it may still sell very small numbers although it may no longer be viable to produce it commercially.Â 


In such circumstances the resale value of existing products increases enormously as the number of products available lessens over time.Â 
Such products become very collectable
$6000 Matchbox Car â€“ Visit the Matchbox Car Museum

 and have investment value, for example, classic cars. 
Other products may not intrinsically be worth much money but are valuable to certain owners or collectors, such as toys that have been used and are in poor condition.Â 




For many centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution, â€œclassicâ€ evoked thoughts of artistry and craft skills, for example, classical architecture and furniture. The advent of mass production and â€œdesigning for the massesâ€ often meant a reduction in quality of products and poor design. However, once mass production techniques became more established some designers embraced the opportunities offered by the new techniques and materials as a way of providing people with well-designed products at an affordable price due to the cost-effectiveness of production. No longer was classic design the preserve of the elite in society.

Characteristics of a Classic Design




Image
Term:Â Within the context of classic design, image relates to the instantly recognizable aesthetics of a particular product. For example, the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle, or the shape of a Volkswagen Beetle motor car.

Image makes a classic design instantly recognisable and provokes emotional reactions

highly recognisable aesthetics
representation of an external form
evokes emotional attachment

Status
Term:Â Products considered as classic designs often increase in value and can project a certain status as they become more desirable. The ownership of a classic design can increase the perceived status of an individual.

A classic design can indicate the status (social position) of an individual.

Increase in the perceived status of a person.
Connections with the elite class
Conveys a feeling of satisfaction.
A feeling of owning a rarity.

Culture
Term:Â In the context of classic design, culture plays an important part. They often reflect cultural influences and mark transition points within a particular culture. The culture of concern may be national, religious or a sub-culture, such as a particular youth culture or movement.
Design classics can reflect cultural influences.

It may be a national or religious cultural influence.

It may concern a sub-culture such as a particular youth culture or movement.

For example UK Skinheadsâ€™ footwear were Dr Martens boots with its yellow stitching.

Nostalgia
A sense of belonging







What first comes to mind when you see Vegemite?

Obsolescence
Term:Â This is the stage in a product life cycle where the product is no longer needed even though it functions as well as it did when first manufactured. Classic designs tend to transcend obsolescence and become desired objects long after they have ceased to be manufactured.

Obsolescence is something becoming obsolete or of no longer any use. Consumer electronics such as your mobile phone often fall into this category. Many people will replace there mobile within a few years.
A classic design defies (transcend) obsolescence.
It is timeless
It is still aÂ desired object long after they have ceased to be manufactured.
A classic design transcends (goes beyond) its original function.
Its unchanging (or minutely changed) design spans time.

Mass production

Mass production contributes to a product reaching classic design status such as the VW shown below or the Bic Pen.

being mass-produced spanning decades leads to it being ever present or omnipresent.
Mass-production made cars affordable (due toÂ economies of scale) so it sold well.
Mass-production made them easily available.
Its simple design (and mechanics) lent itself to mass production.



VW Beetle vs Transporter
Ubiquitous/Omnipresence
Term: Omnipresence â€“ In the context of classic design, a product that is omnipresent has existed and been in circulation for a long time.
Term: Ubiquitous â€“Â In the context of classic design, a product that is ubiquitous is one that can be found almost everywhere. For example, a mobile phone.

A classic design often has a constant presence, orÂ omnipresence, in a rapidly changing context and has been in constant circulation.

Ball point pens
Dominant Design
Term:Â The design contains those implicit features of a product that are recognized as essential by a majority of manufacturers and purchasers.



For example Coca-cola â€“ the shape of the bottle, the font and red colour.


Classic designs that are also Â dominant designs Â in the marketplace are difficult to change them.

because it is popular or omni-presencent
those that have defied obsolescence and have been a round a long time tend to have emotional attachments
Nostalgia
Dominant design has been around a while, if it changes not so recognisable and the company could risk profits



The â€œQWERTYâ€ keyboard layout was specifically designed (to make people inefficient) to replace the flaws of the mechanical typewriter by changing the order of the letters on the keyboard. Now it is recognised as well used worldwide and preferred over the more logical and formal keyboard layouts. By the way, did you know that you can type faster one handed than on a QWERTY keyboard.

Â Essay on Emotion and DesignÂ 
Book on Emotional Design6.2 Classic Design, Function and Form





Classic design holds â€œform follows functionâ€ as a fundamental principle, but this is not always evident in practice. Some products are so well designedÂ with function as their primary goal, that their use is intuitive. As designers develop new technologies, the lines between the form and function of a product continue to blur.




The balance between function and form is often an area of difficulty for the designer. IfÂ a product is purely functional, it may be lacking in appeal to consumers, no matter how goodÂ it may be at completing its job. Often we are drawn to products that have been developed with form as a primary consideration. The human psyche appreciates beauty.








Classic designs are harmonious, well-proportioned in form and often restrained in style. To reinterpret a classic design, the original form needs to be respected and the underlying structure of the form understood before making changes. Decoration applied must be suitable for the form and take into account the function of the object, although â€œclassicâ€ does not necessarily mean the style needs to be minimalist in nature or lacking in decoration.

Form versus function




Term: Form â€“Â Also considered as the three-dimensional space that a product takes up, in the context of classic design, form relates to the shape of a product and the aesthetic qualities that the shape gives.


Term: Function â€“ Products can be considered classic designs based on how well they fulfil the task that they have been designed for.


Not all classic designs are based on form Â orÂ aesthetics as a main reason for the design or product.

For example, the designers of many early examples of mass production motor cars that are now considered â€œclassicsâ€ were more interested in function than form. 

The Volkswagen (VW) Beetle, designed by Ferdinand Porsche in the 1930s, was aimed at ordinary people with a modest income and Porsche economized on many features considered as standard and necessary today, such as a rear window. 
Alec Issigonis designed the first Mini motor car to be as economical and functional as possible and priced so it was affordable by the majority of working people in the late 1950s.

Activity:Â Compare the original production models of the Â VW beetle, BMW or the Mini cars with their more modern day versions. Â Consider form verses function. Go to the Padlet.

Practical Function versus Psychological Function
The tension between form and function when developing new products based on a classic design
Practical function is mostly concerned with criteria related to the performance of the product, such as dimensions, weight, ease of use, etc.

These areÂ quantifiable and as a result an objective evaluation can be carried out. (Quantitative data)
Anglepoise Â lamp design by George Carwardine (an UK engineer) in 1947 is an example where practical function is of a primary concern over form.
Carwardine was interested in an apparatus that could move easily through three planes but would be rigid when left free. It was many years before Carwardine worked on this concept as a versatile â€œarmâ€ for focusing light on an object. Although Carwardine made no particular effort to make his lamp an object of beauty, its clean and functional form has established the Anglepoise lamp as a design classic.Â 

Psychological functionÂ is mostly concerned withÂ the different emotional reactions or attachmentsÂ people have with products such as mobile phones or their favourite piece of apparel.


These are subjective criteria. (qualitative data)
The Juicy Salif lemon squeezer, designed by Philip Starck in 1990 and produced by the Italian company Alessi, is an example of how the psychological function dictates the form of an object. The design was conceived on a napkin while Starck enjoyed a dish of squid in a restaurant and was squeezing lemon over it. Starck is quoted as saying that his juicer is less concerned with squeezing lemons than as a conversation starter. An example of Starckâ€™s lemon squeezer is on display in the New York Museum of Modern Art.Â 

The way in which humans need to interact with objects often dictates their form. This interaction may be classified into three aspects:

assembling the object either during manufacture or at home (self-assembly)
using it
repairing or maintaining it.

For example, when designing mobile phones the success of the human-interaction interface is important, there, a compromise of function over form, in this case.





Anglepoise Lamp

Juicy Salif Lemon Squeezr



Conflict and Compromise

Conflict and compromise can occur during the development of the product.
Â Teams of specialists comprising of ergonomists, electrical engineers, materials engineers and product designersÂ are involved in the development of industrial designed products.
Â Form over function may be an important aspect of the design for some members while for others it maybe function overÂ form.
When considering form, students need to understand how it can be dictated by other functions such as design for manufacture techniques, for example, design for disassembly.
â€œDesigners traditionally find themselves trying to perform a balancing act between conflicting design parameters; weight versus strength, speed versus life, efficiency versus complexity, or efficiency versus cost, to name but a few common trade-off scenariosâ€ from The TRZ Journal

Art Deco (Retro-Styling)

Art Deco Style Â (1930â€™s) has its roots form the exclusive hand-made French decorative arts (1920â€™s).
ItÂ became incredibly popular decades later due to mass production (economies of scale) ofÂ products using different materials, such as metals, plastic and glass.
Being a decorative style it was easily added to many products (lamps, furniture) or surfaces (e.g. buildings)
It was used widely in Architecture and lighting.

International Mindedness











The emergence of retro-styling products as new technologies are developed relate to the emotional response that comes with nostalgia. This is often not only different between countries and between generations, but at the same time can transcend both.






Theory of knowledge




Is aesthetic value purely a subjective matter?










Something Extra â€¦7.1 User-centred design (UCD)





A designer must consider the needs, wants and limitations of the end user within every element ofthe design cycle. The ability to identify how users will interact with a product, service or system is vital forits success. To achieve this, designers must be ableÂ to acquire and analyse valid data without making assumptions aboutÂ how the product may be used.





The ability to put aside oneâ€™s own ideas and bias is essential for UCD. Designers must act with integrity and not project their own ideas of what the user requirements are when trying to create technological solutions to their problems.






The Designer Needs to Have a Deep Understanding of the User, Task and the Environment.
Donald Norman (who developed the concept) found that products:

were difficult to use.
often included style changes solely for style sake which reduced usability.
these inclusions increased the cost.
increased complexity.
reduction in efficient use.









The principles of UCD to the design process.



A design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments.
Users are involved throughout design and development.
The design is driven and refined by user-centred evaluation.
The process is iterative.
The design addresses the whole user experience.
The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives,Â  such as Don Normanâ€™s engineering and psychology degrees.
Students should be able to apply theÂ above.



User-Centered Design and the User, Task & Environment





Term:Â UCD is a design process paying particular attention to the needs of potential users of a product through involvement of users at all stages of the design process.
Term: Empathetic â€“ When the designer takes the place of the user to see who potentially could use the product and the object could be better suited for the consumer.





The Uncomfortable web site â€“ non UCD




User-Centered Design and the User
User-Centered Design and the Task
User-Centered Design and the Environment


Term: User â€“Â Person utilising the product, person who is being affected by the product or who is reaping benefits/drawbacks.
Term: Task â€“Â The thing that the product is supposed to do, however the user may have several sub uses for the product.
Term: Environment â€“Â The place where a product is likely to be used.




It considers how users are likely to use the product and tests products with actual users. 
Sometimes called â€œempathic designâ€, the user-centred approach puts the design team in direct contact with the people they are designing for, that is, to empathize with potential users and so gain a better understanding of usersâ€™ thoughts, needs, values and beliefs.Â 
Often functionality can be included easily and cheaply into a design but too many can reduce it usability.
Electronic interfaces such has TV or satelliteÂ remotes is a good example where the complex functionality is too much to understand for most consumers.




Takes into account common tasks such as ticketing vending machines, ATM or a stove top need special consideration
The interface should be a standard that is the user goes from stove top to another or different Bank ATMâ€™s it is easily understood and can perform the task easily and efficiently
Important functions are easily recognised.




Takes into account in the use of a product in a particular environment.
Environments like open plan office, car or kitchen (working envelope).

The Process is Iterative, Led by the User and Developed Through User-Centred Evaluation
Term: Iterative â€“ Act of repeating a process with the aim of approaching a desired goal, target or result. Each repetition of the process is also called an iteration, and the results of one iteration are used as the starting point for the next iteration.
UCD is iterative just like the design cycle. Here though emphasis is on the user throughout the product design cycle. At each stage the user is consulted and modifications are made until the consumer requirements are met. Then it is released. See below the Five Stages of UCD

UCD Design Teams are Multidisciplinary.
As can be seen from the five stages of UCD that many other experts are used in the design andÂ production of a UCD product.
These include: anthropologistsÂ (study humans, human behaviors and society), Â ethnographersÂ (study in people and cultures), engineers (deal with the built environment), psychologists (study of the mind) and focus groups to advise the creative designers.




Inclusive Design
Term: The design of mainstream products and/or services so that they are accessible and usable by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation or specialised design.

UCD is a part of Inclusive design. Inclusive design is about designing universally accessible products for all users regardless of age, physical, sensory, perceptual functioning levels (disability). By designing products for all users regardless abilityÂ will ensureÂ there is a market for their products and increases their feasibility as an innovation.
Inclusive design is:

Welcoming to everyone
Responsive to peopleâ€™s needs
Intuitive to use
Flexible
Convenient so they can be used without undue effort or special separation and so that they maximise independence


The design council on Inclusive design (the video above)

Inclusive Design

The Product Must Address the Whole User Experience.
Term: User Experience â€“ A personâ€™s perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service, this can modify over time due to changing usage circumstances.

UCD answers questions about users and their tasks and goals, then uses the findings to make decisions about development and design.



Who are the users of the product?
What are the usersâ€™ tasks and goals?
What are the usersâ€™ experiences and expertise with the product and products like it?
What functionality do the users require of the product?
What other stakeholders will be impacted by the product?
Why is the product being developed?
What are the overall objectives?
How will the product be used?
How will it be judged a success?
What are the technical and environmental constraints?
What functionality is needed by users?
What are the typical scenarios of how and why users will use the product?
What are the usability goals?
How important is ease of use and ease of learning?
How long should it take users to complete their tasks?
Is it important to minimize user errors?
Are there any initial design concepts?












International Mindedness





Even though the task addressed through UCD may not change from region to region, there can be an impact on the success of a global product due to variations in users and environments.

http://www.usability.gov
http://www.usabilitynet.org/papers/First_Steps_to_User_Centred.pdf7.2 Usability





A design team should be â€œuserâ€ driven andÂ frequent contact with potential users is essential. To understand how a product, service or system may be used, the designer must consider the priorÂ knowledge and experience of the users, as well as their typical psychological responses. Evaluation methods that utilize appropriate testing and trialling strategies must be used to determine these aspects




Designers must consider the limits of population stereotypes. Through recognizing these limits, the designers can critically assess the appropriateness of their product in relation to those who will use it.






Usability is how well a human-made product (tool, machine, webpage, a system or process) can be effectively (completely and accurately) and efficiently (fast and with minimum effort) used by users.
It functionsÂ Â in a predictable and consistent way.
The human-made product can be considered intuitive, pleasant, enjoyableÂ to use,Â preventsÂ user errors or if errors occur then the user can easily recover.

From the ISO â€¦ Usability is concerned with â€œthe extent to which a product can beÂ used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of useâ€ (ISO 9241-11, 1998)
Usability objectives
Usefulness

Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
Efficiently â€“ fast and with minimum effort

Effectiveness

Use the design completely and accurately
Prevents errors
User can recoverÂ if errors occur.

Learnability

It is the ease at whichÂ the user can learn to use a product?
TheÂ intuitiveness to use a product, service or system design.
How easy is it for users to accomplish tasks the first time they encounter the design?
Memorable â€“ when the user returns they do not have to re-learn how to use it.

Attitude

Satisfaction or likabilityÂ Â when the client uses orÂ interacts with the product, service or system design.
How pleasant is it to use the design?

Enhanced usability
Benefits of enhanced usability include:

improved product acceptance
improved user experience
improved productivity
reducesÂ user error
reduces the need for training and support

Characteristics of good user-product interfaces
Characteristics of good user-product interfacesÂ (is the space where a user and machine interact) include:

Simplicity â€“ simple design allows for clarity on how the design can be used such as an iPod interface.
Ease of use â€“Â iPod interface has limited menu items that areÂ easily and quickly accessed.
Intuitive logic and organization â€“Â Novice users of a product should be able to learn all its basic functions within one or two hours.

However, many products are full of confusing detail and are difficult to learn. This can lead to incomplete use of the productâ€™s functionality and frustration for the user.
Instruction manuals are often poorly written and poorly organized.




It is difficult for the designer of a product to distance him/herself from the product andÂ look at it through the eyes of the prospectiveÂ user. Reinnovation of a product often involves adding features to the basic design rather than redesigning the userâ€“product interface from scratch, and this can result in a disorganized interface. It is important to consider necessary
and desirable features, not ones that increase complexity without enhancing usefulness for most users.







Low memory burden â€“ the user does not need to have to memorise many features, how to use it, etc.

Do not have to relearn functions. Â Poor organization of a product imposes a memory burden on users, who have to learn and remember how the various functions work.
This results in them not using the full functionality of a product but focusing on a limited set of features and ignoring those that are difficult to remember.
Thinking about how intuitively the product features can be accessed by users can reduce memory burden and make the product more user-friendly.


Visibility â€“Â Controls should be visible and it should be obvious how they work.

They should convey the correct message, for example, with doors that need to be pushed, the designer must provide signals that indicate where to push.


Feedback â€“Â Feedback is the provision of information, for example, an audible tone to a user, as a result ofÂ an action. 

The tone on a telephone touchpad or the click of a key on a computer keyboard provides feedback to indicate that a key has been pressed. 
The â€œegg timerâ€ icon on a computer screen tells the user that an action is being undertaken.


Affordance â€“ Â Affordance is the property of an object that indicates how it can be used.

Buttons afford pushing, and knobs afford turning.
On a door, handles afford pulling, whereas push plates afford pushing.
Consider how the use of a handle on a door that needs to be pushed open can confuse users, and how in an emergency this might impact on safety considerations.


Mapping â€“ Â Mapping relates to the correspondence between the layout of the controls and their required action.

For example, the layout of the controls on a cooker hob can take advantage of physical analogiesÂ and cultural standards to facilitate a userâ€™s understanding of how it works.


Constraints â€“ Â Constraints limit the way that a product can be used.

The design of a three-pin plug or a USB (universal serial bus) device ensures that they are inserted the correct way.
This reduces or eliminates the possibility of a user making errors.



The userâ€“product interfaces of many electronic products are extremely complex rather than being intuitive and easy to use. Products with intuitive and easily accessible interfaces are likely to be more popular with consumers.
Population stereotypes





A stereotype is when a person is catorgerised into a population based on culture, class, gender, etc. This allows assumptions and associations on how that particular stereotyped population may, react in a situation, dress, use of products, aesthetics, values and so on.

White is Western culture symbolizes, purity, elegance and peace. Brides often where white wedding gowns. In Asian cultures white represents, death, mourning or bad luck. Traditionally white is worn at funerals.

A short list of different traditional wedding dress colors.
This has implications on color selection and aesthetics.


In Australia and China, to turn a light switch it is flipped down. In the USA it is flipped up.

This has implications of standardization of products.


In Australia and China the difference int he orientation of a 3 pin electrical wall socket is another example.

101 Usability7.3 Strategies for user research

Designers should select research strategies based on the desired user experiences in the context ofÂ the product, service or system. The purpose ofÂ user research is to identify needs that reveal the complexities of personae. Real-life scenarios that simulate â€œactualâ€ user experiences can generate new findings.




The various strategies for user research can be used by the designer to explore the true nature of a problem. Through the use of personae and use cases, the designer can build a range of possible scenarios with which to explore the problem in detail.


User population








User population is a range of users for a particular product or system.
A product maybe design for a particular population.

Easy grip can opener for people with arthritis


On the other hand, some products can be Â designed for use by different or multiple populations.
When considering strategies for user research, designers need to consider their appropriateness in relation to user populations.

Â 
Classification of users

People of user populations areÂ classified into groups basedÂ on age, gender and physical condition.Â 

physical conditions may include mobility issues, amputees, blindness, arthritis and so on.


This can allow the designer to gather detailed feedback to generate insights for design development that are particular to each group. 
For example, a group of users who suffer from arthritis in their wrists would have different concerns with the design of a new kettle and give different feedback than a population of students.
Another example is IDEOâ€™s project in designing homes for wounded war veterans.


Â 
Â The use of personae
Designers can observe and interview members of a user population in order to create fictional characters known as personae, secondary personae and anti-personae.

PersonaeÂ are the primary target audience they are theÂ â€˜typicalâ€™ stakeholder.
Secondary personaeÂ  are not the primary target audience for a product, but whose needs the product should meet.

They provide valuable â€˜alternativeâ€™ insights to the development of a product.


Anti-personaeÂ are those for whom the product is not designed.
PersonasÂ are used to collect data to better understand the market.

Design considers the needs of individuals as paramount. Is this the case in other areas of knowledge?

Something Extra:7.4 Strategies for user-centred design (UCD)





For designers to successfully integrate usabilityÂ into the design process, they require a holisticÂ understanding of how a product, service or systemÂ is used. Designers must identify user requirementsÂ through the use of careful observation and interviews.Â A clear strategy for UCD will improve acceptabilityÂ and usability, reducing costs and effort, while fulfilling user requirements.




By including potential consumers in the testing of designs and prototypes, designers gain valuable data relating to how they will interact with a product.









The strategies forÂ UCD:
DesignKit has a good explanation and case studies
Field research

A first hand observation of customerâ€™s user experience.
It is essential for the research to be conducted in the userâ€™s environment.
These can be field trials, ethnographic interviews or observations in the real world





Advantages
Disadvantages




Gain first hand knowledge
Gain first hand experience
Obtain detailed data of people and processes
It emphasizes the role and relevance of social context.




Data will be very narrow
emotional taxing as relationship between interviewer and client has to be established.





Method of extremes

A common sampling method where users are selected to represent the extremes of a user population, typically the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile.
Products are then designed and/or tested to ensure that they function efficiently for those users.
Design equipment for general use
Another explanation from DesignKit
A an interesting blog post

Slideshow on Extremes



Advantages
Disadvantages




greatest number of users are accommodated




maybe sensitive for extreme groups to be involved





Observation

Essentially is Â a user trial where the intended client uses the product and the expert observes.
This can be in the field (natural environment) or in a lab (controlled environment)




Advantages
Disadvantages




Help to unveil usability issues
Tested under conditions of use




Data collected maybe difficult to analyse





Interviews and Focus groups

A collection of responses from users, a trail of observation of users interacting with the product





Advantages
Disadvantages




It is Â dynamic
Face to Face
Body language and gestures can be observed
Easily measure reactions
Clarifying questions can be asked




Â Expensive as interviewees are often compensated
Participants may not wish to share sensitive issues
Small sample size may not be truly representative of the whole
Moderator bias





Questionnaires

A series of questions to solicit information




Advantages
Disadvantages




Cheap
Easy to administer
large numbers of questionnaires can be administered
sent easily to a wide local, national, global regions




Static
poor number of responses
maybe only interested people fill out the survey thus perhaps a bias





Affinity diagramming

A graphical tool that identifies a general theme to collect facts, opinions and ideas.
They express data and infromation in a common format by creating clusters and groups of common information.
It represents a text based map which shows aspects of the product that has been/will be taken into consideration in the design and manufacturing of the product, thereby presenting the results.

Advantages
Disadvantages




Simple
Cost effective
Easy to get data from a group

can get quite large





Participatory design, prototype and usability testing session.

Participatory designÂ Â is an approach to design attempting to actively involve all stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and isÂ usable. (Wikipedia)
An example ofÂ participatory designÂ is when users representing the target market for a product perform realistic tasks by interacting with a paper version of the user-product interface manipulated by a person acting as a computer who does not explain how the interface works.



PrototypeÂ see Topic 3 on modelling
Usability testing is carried out in aÂ usability laboratory. Typically, users are seated with an instructor who observes them performing a particular task with the product. Another group of observers is behind a one-way mirror, where they can record the activity and note insights. Often the tests are recorded for later reference and analysis.


Â 
Natural environments and usability laboratories








Â Natural environments
Â Usability laboratories




The potential client is observed using the product, system or service where it is intended to be used
Advantage: solicit data from real and intendedÂ contexts
Advantage: usability is tested in the intended environment
Disadvantage: biased opinions from the observers
Disadvantage: mostly qualitative data is collected.




The potential client is observed using the product, system or serviceÂ in a controlled.
Advantage: controlled environment can ensure that product/service/system is used as intended.
Advantage:Â Groups of â€˜observersâ€™ can view the usability and a more wider view of analysis
Advantage: labs can be set up with high-tech sensors and equipment for better monitoring.
Disadvantage: can be costly as facilities/personnel Â must be hired.
Disadvantage: can be intimidating to know people are behind one-way mirrors





Â Testing houses versus usability laboratories
There are many advantages and disadvantages between using natural environments and usability laboratories and between using usability laboratories and testing houses for design companies.
Â 


International Mindedness
Testing in the environment where a product will be used is often extremely important for the design of products, especially where the problem to solve occurs in a country foreign to the design team.





Theory of Knowledge




Is it ever possible to eliminate the effect of the observer?




To what extent does the language used on questionnaires shape the results?




Something Extra â€¦7.5 Beyond usabilityâ€”designing for pleasure and emotion





A designerâ€™s ability to provide satisfactionÂ through aesthetic appeal and pleasure can greatly influence the success of a product, service orÂ system. Understanding attitudes, expectations and motivations of consumers plays a significant role in predicting product interaction. Designers need to be empathetic and sympathetic to user emotion, whichÂ acts as a critical component to determine how he or she interprets and interacts with a product, service or system.Â 




The ability to express emotion throughÂ a product can not only build appeal for the consumer, but also build affinity between a product and consumer. It can enable a product to communicate how one should interact with it.






Why Design for Pleasure/Emotion
Online book from ScienceDirect on Design for Emotion.

Attitude: The perceptions, feelings and opinions about a product by a user.
We want to create products that people love.
To make it a pleasure to use â€“ reduce complexity â€“ itâ€™s usable!
People become â€˜attachedâ€™ to a product
Engage the user/consumer in the product
This will also develop brand loyalty

if a consumer is satisfied with the product, theyâ€™ll come back


IncreaseÂ or maintain sales for a company
and Mr TÂ says â€˜its just niceâ€™ (donâ€™t write this bulletÂ on your exam)









The four-pleasure framework
The four-pleasure framework was identified by Professor Lionel Tiger from Rutgers University in New Jersey, USA. It includes the following areas.Â 
Socio-pleasureÂ 

Is derived from social interaction. 
Products and services can facilitate social interaction in a number of ways.
Examples include:

Email, internet and mobile phones that facilitate communication between people. 
Products may promote social interaction by being conversation starters, for example, jewelry, artwork or furniture. 
Clothing can communicate social identity and indicate that a person belongs to a particular social group.Â 



Physio-pleasureÂ 

Is derived from the feel of a product during use 
Examples include:

wearing a silk garment or the smooth feel of an iPod/iPhone, 
taste such as eating chocolate
smell of leather, a new car, coffee or freshly baked breadÂ 



Psycho-pleasureÂ 

IsÂ derived from the cognitive demands of using a product or service and the emotional reactions engendered through the experience of using it.
The outcome may also be more emotionally satisfying and less stressful.Â 
Examples include:

it might be expected that a word processor that facilitated quick and easy accomplishment of tasks would provide a higher level of psycho-pleasure than one with which the user was likely to make many errors. The former word processor should enable the user to complete the task more easily than he or she would with the latter.Â 



Ideo-pleasureÂ 

IsÂ derived from products that are aesthetically pleasing by appealing to the consumerâ€™s values. 
Values could be philosophical or religious or may relate to some particular issue such as the environment or a political movement.
These values can be embodied in products. 
Examples include:

A product made from biodegradable materials might be seen as embodying the value of environmental responsibility.Â 



Design for emotion




Designing for emotion can increase:





User engagement
Product or brand Â loyalty
Satisfaction withÂ a product by incorporating emotion and personality







Visceral design:Â Design that speaks to peopleâ€™s nature in terms of how they expect products and systems to function and how they expect to interact with them.
Reflective Design:Â Design that evokes personal memory focussing on the message, culture and the meaning of a product or its use.





Behavioural design:Â Focussed on use and understanding, this considers how people will use a product, focussing on functionality.
This is a good website going into more depth from Usabilla.





Design for Emotion

What is design ..

















The attract/converse/transact (ACT) model




How the ACT model can be used as a framework for creating designs that intentionally trigger positive emotional responses




Â Attract/Converse/Transact (ACT) model (Van Gorp, Adams 2012)* is a framework for creating designs that improve the relations of users with a product and intentionally trigger emotional responses.



TheÂ attractÂ part of the model is aesthetics oriented.Â 






TheÂ converseÂ part of the model is interaction oriented.Â 
TheÂ transactÂ part of the model is function oriented.Â

When all three elements are addressed, products can become desirable, usable and useful.

Designers utilize design approaches that support sustainable development across a variety of contexts. A holistic and systematicÂ approach is needed atall stages of design development to satisfy all stakeholders. In order to develop sustainable products, designers must balance aesthetic, cost, social, cultural, energy, material, health and usability considerations.




Triple bottom line sustainability does not only focus on the profitability of an organization or product, but also the environmental and social benefit it can bring.Â 
Organizations that embrace triple bottom line sustainability can make significant positive effects to the lives of others and the environment by changing the impact of their business activities.

TBL



Environmental Aspect of TBL

It is technically possible to deliver the same or equivalent goods and services with lower environmental impact while maintaining social and equity benefits.
Is involved in maintaining the ecosystem by optimising (using) its resources more prudently.

This could include redesigning production system to be more efficient.
Maintaining ecosystem integrity
Assess and work within the carrying capacityÂ (the size of a population that an ecosystemÂ can support without degradation of social, economic and environmental systems).
Recognising and maintaining Â biodiversity.


Historically there has been a close correlation between economic growth and environmental degradationâ€”as economic prosperity increases so environmental quality decreases.Â 

This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers, economic growth and environmental indicators,Â seeÂ graph below.


Sustainable development frameworks enable the evaluation of the complex and interrelated concepts that are associated with development.













Correlation graph

CO2 Emissions vs GDP











SocialÂ Â Aspect of TBL

There is a correlation between economic development and human well-being.

See graph below.
International Development on Wikipedia. It mentions economics influence.


Social sustainability:

Designing to develop goods and services for the enhancement of human well-being,
maintaining cultural identity,
empowerment of local communities,
accessibility to resources and services,
stability of communities not placing them in upheaval
social and gender equity



GDP vs Social Indicators
EconomicÂ  Aspect of TBL

Economic development increase the GDP and spending power of people this results in consumption of resources leading to a negativeÂ environmental impact.
Designing for sustainability is dependent upon an understanding of the short- and long-term goals and values of individuals, institutions and governments.
It is about the big picture that allows economic activity to rise while:

reducing resource use and reducing environmental impact.
maintaining economic growth,
development,
improving productivity,
facilitates the economic trickle-down affect to local communities


Close cooperation is required between designer and manufacturer.
The importance of sustainability issues and strategies is critical to sustainable economic development.

Decoupling
Term: DecouplingÂ refers to disconnecting two trends so that one no longer depends on the other.Â Through the act of decoupling (using resources more productively and redesigning production systems), it is technically possible to deliver the same or equivalent goods and services with lower environmental impact while maintaining social and equity benefits.

Decoupling isÂ a strategy for sustainability
Consider the benefits and limitations of decoupling as an appropriate strategy for sustainability

Decoupling impacts and resources â€“ from the UNEP
International and National Laws

The use of international and national laws to promote sustainable development

Nations need to adhere to the treaties/laws usually through enforceable domestic legislation.


International and national laws encourage companies to focus on something other than shareholder value and financial performance
Adopting a corporate strategy that has the support of shareholders/stakeholders can be difficult to achieve.Â 

International and national laws encourage companies to focus on aspects other than shareholder value and financial performance,
These include transparency of corporate sustainability, transparent sustainability assurance and whether businesses, public services, national resources and the economy have the means to continue in the years ahead at aÂ microÂ andÂ macroÂ level.

Sustainability Reporting
Term: A company report that focusses on four aspects of performance: Economic; Environmental; Social; and Governance.
A sustainability report is an organisation report that provides information on its performance in 4 areas:

Economic
Environmental
Social
Governance

The reliability and acceptance of sustainability reporting requires accurate data gathering to be maintained over a lengthy period of time.Â 
Benefits of sustainability reporting for:



Governments
Manufacturers
Consumers




the information can be used to assess the impact on the economy, society and the environment

with the information can target areas of concern and help drive progress on sustainability
compliance with legislation




can drive innovation (product or systems) within an organisation
can use it as marketing
enhanced branding/reputation
potential cost savings
efficient governance and management




potential cheaper products or services

Product Stewardship





Product Stewardship at a company

Product Stewardship





Everyone involved in making, selling, buying or handling equipment (products) takes responsibility for minimizing environmental impact of the equipment at all stages in the life cycle.
Designers may need to respond to consumer pressure as more consumers become aware of resource issues and product labelling.Â 

Some examples Â of product stewardship include:














Organic foods

Genetically modified food



Green cotton â€“Â 

Article on Green Cotton in fashion


Forest stewardship â€“

Â International Mindedness
Changes in governments sometimes result in the reversal of sustainable development policies leading to different approaches to international agreements.
Theory of Knowledge
Design involves making value judgments in deciding between different ways of interacting with the environment. Is this the case in other areas of knowledge?

Something extra â€¦

Explain how sustainable development requires close cooperation between manufacturers and government.

Both parties will have different definitions for sustainable development
Governments have targets that need to be met
Must be communicated to industry
Meeting those targets will cost industry money especially if they are radical system changes.
Governments need to listen to industry


Explain how a close relationship between manufacturers and government can be difficult to achieve because the two parties may have very different perspectives on sustainability and time-scales.

Industry is more concerned with profits and would most likely continue using unsustainable practises until told to otherwise.
Governments what sustainable practises implemented for what ever reasons
Pressure on Governments to speed implementing sustainable practises
Industry will â€˜drag its heelsâ€™ since system level changes can be expensive at the start.

Designers develop products, services and systems that satisfy basic needs and improve quality of life. To meet sustainable consumption requirements, they must also minimize the use of natural resources, toxic materials and waste, and reduce emissions of pollutants at all stages of the life cycle.




It is not only the role of designersÂ to create markets for sustainable products. Consumers need to change their habits and express a want and need for these products.





Sustainable Consumption
Term: The consumption of goods and services that have minimal environmental impact, promote social equity and economically viable, whilst meeting basic human needs worldwide.



Sustainable consumption is not about consuming less but consuming differently. 
Designers need to recognize the importance of consumerism in developed countries and as an ambition in many developing countries.
Societies, particularly in developed countries, are [tend to be] a throwaway society.
Consumers need to be encouraged to repair and reuse products rather than throw them away.Â 


Sustainable design and sustainable production contribute to sustainable consumption. 
This can be achieved in a number of ways, for example, not buying more food than needed and reducing waste; changing attitudes to water and energy use, for example, turning taps off when brushing teeth, aerated water in showers, less water per flush of the toilet, grey water.Â 

Consumer Attitudes
Consumer attitudes and behaviours towards sustainability can be classified into 4 groups.
Eco-warriors:
Term: Individuals or groups that actively demonstrate on environmental issues.

ItÂ is an individual who cares about our environment & the diversity of life forms so much that they want to take action.
An eco-warrior can be someone such as non-confrontational as a tree sitter or someone who engages in direct action, ranging anywhere from planting tree spikes into trees on public lands, to keep the lumber industry from cutting them down, to sit-ins which occupy a corporate office.


Eco-champions:




Term: Individuals or groups that champion environmental issues within organizations.





Champion environmental issues within organizations.
Attempt to introduce or create change in a product, process, or method that takes into account green or environmental issues


Is a person who fights or argues for a cause.




Eco-fans:
Term:Â Individuals or groups that enthusiastically adopt environmentally friendly practices as consumers.

It is usuallyÂ someone who accepts all green design products on the current market or its related objectives.
An eco-fan will usually buy anything that is environmentally friendly and will never buy a harmful product.

Green Attitude to Buying Green â€“ click on the image
Eco-phobes:
Term: Individuals or groups that actively resent talk of environmental protection.

Eco-phobes are people who are against helping the environment and purposely go against the ecological movements.
They believe that the environmental problems are irrelevant to their lives or are blown out of proportion.
Wikipedia reference to environmental denial
An example of an eco-phobe is a head of a country refusing to sign the Kyoto agreement which is based on controlling the c02 output in a country and limit it in order to decrease global warming.






Eco-Labelling and Energy Labelling Schemes

For the designer such labels can help guide their designing in order to meet country regulations or the manufacturers design specifications.
When designers design products they need to take into consideration the criteria that make up the different Â eco and energy labels for different labelling schemes.
For the consumer they can make the appropriate purchase if they are environmentally concerned.Â Â Different countries ahed differentÂ  contexts.
International standardisation has resulted in manyÂ Â eco- and energy labelling schemes being similar thus easy for the consigner to understand.









https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux75rCBPwFc



Eco-labelling:
Term:Â The labelling of products to demonstrate that they are better for the environment than other products.

Provides reliable information about how the product impacts the environment, considering all stages of the productâ€™s life cycle: manufacture, distribution, use and disposal. An example of this is Swan eco-label.
Aids in the improvement of the workers have a role in the productionâ€™s social and economic conditions, like the Fair Trade Labelling.
Informs customers about how the energy is produced, and whether it meets certain requirements, like those of The FANC energy eco-labelling scheme.
Allows consumers to make informed choices.









Â The European eco-label believes in sustainable development. They are based on the vision of greening non-food products all over Europe. The eco-label â€˜normsâ€™ are decided by the European Union Eco-labeling (EUEB).
Â In Australia, Good Environmental Choice Australia (GECA)is committed to credible product information for sustainable development. It is the only environmental labeling program in Australia which indicates the environmental performance of a product during its complete life cycle.
Â In the United States there is an eco label named Energy stars, which is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy that promotes energy efficient products and practices. The Nutriclean label means that products are tested



Energy-labelling:
Term: The labelling of products to show how energy efficient they are. TheÂ label displays information in four categories: the productâ€™s details; Energy classification that shows the productâ€™s electrical consumption; Measurements relating to consumption, efficiency and capacity etc.; Noise emitted from the product when in use.

The label provides/displays four pieces of Â information:

The productâ€™s details; 
Energy classification that shows the productâ€™s electrical consumption; 
Measurements relating to consumption, efficiency and capacity etc.; 
Noise emitted from the product when in use.


It shows the user how much energy is required/used by a product, as well as how efficient it is (how much heat-loss for example)
By using such labels, consumers can make their choices in products, by taking into account how much energy (toll on the environment) is used by the product.
By comparing theses two labels. and with consumer help, more environmentally friendly products could be sold therefore making companies use greener design.
As with Eco-labelling this label is given by a third party company





Australian Energy Label




Market for Sustainable Products
Corporate strategies have an Â impact on the design brief or specifications, such as, market development, where we take an existing product and develop a new segment.
Creating a market for sustainable products:

pricing considerations: ensuring the products proved value-for-money to the customer.

such as an eBikes that use cheaper lead-acid batteries vs lithium ion batteries.


long term costs

For example incandescent bulbs are very cheap and long life bulbs tend to more expensive. The Incandescent bulbs need regular changing


stimulating demand for green products

consumers must be convinced that the green product is of similar or better quality
is competitively priced
promote their green products


production of green products

taking into consideration triple bottom line sustainability
JIT manufacturing
Â end-of-pipe or better still radical change to manufacturing

Pressure Groups





Collections of individuals who hold a similar viewpoint on a particular topic, for example the environment, who take action to promote positive change to meet their goals.





â€œNon-profit and usuallyÂ voluntary organizationÂ whoseÂ membersÂ have aÂ common causeÂ for which they seek toÂ influenceÂ political or corporateÂ decisionÂ makersÂ toÂ achieveÂ a declaredÂ objective. WhereasÂ interest groupsÂ try to defend a cause (maintainÂ theÂ status quo), the pressure groups try toÂ promoteÂ it (changeÂ the status quo).â€ (Business dictionary)

Pressure groups are not a market segment but they can influence the market and product cycle. 
Some large organizations have evolved to inform consumers about environmental issues and ethical issues relating to the activities of certain multinational corporations. 
These pressure groups are able to exert considerable influence to press for changes on these issues and to support or undermine development of specific technologies, for example, GM food production. 
Consumer and environmental pressure groups can attract widespread support using the media (including social media). 
Consumers have become increasingly aware of information provided by these organizations and, as markets have globalized, so has consumer power.

Advantages and disadvantages of consumer and environmental pressure groups for the user, manufacturer and designer



User
Manufacturer
Designer


Advantages


new products (green or innovative)




in long run costs reduced

Disadvantages


new products may cost more
products become obsolete




forced to develop new products
add costs due to changes in design or manufacturing




forced to change design ideas
constrained in creativity





Other Advantages

raise public awareness of environmental issues
can have large numbers of members that can exert pressure on political parties (small smaller in numbers)
can have expertise related tot he issues

Other Disadvantages

they may be biased towards their cause â€“ not looking at both sides
sometimes not objective
make use extreme tactics or break the law
opinions on issues may not be representative of the wider community





Lifestyle and Ethical Consumerism
Ethical Consumerism:Â The practice of consciously purchasing products and services produced in a way that minimises social and environmental damage, while avoiding those that have a negative impact on society and the environment.




Lifestyle Consumerism: A social and economic order and ideology that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever greater amounts.





Consider strategies for managing western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing resource use and environmental impact.
Some companies incorporate ethics into their corporate strategy and designers need to work within such constraints. 
They aim to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact.





Implications of Take-Back Legislation for Designers, Manufacturers and Consumers
Take back legislation is the legislation that holds manufacturers responsible for the environmentally safe recycling or disposal of their end-of-life products. They are expected to provide a financial and/or physical plan to ensure that such products are collected and processed.

Apple, in 2016, introduced a take back program where you can get a discounted price on a new phone.
In Maine in the U.S.A., Car manufacturers have take-back legislation in the sense that they have to pay the collection and recycling of mercury switches from old cars.
In March 2003 the UK government issued a legislation requiring that all car manufacturerâ€™s and vehicle importers of new cars into the United Kingdom take back vehicles from their previous owner and guarantee that they are treated environmentally friendly.
In Sweden, Producers and importers must take back for free a piece of old equipment (all electrical household appliance) when the customer buys a new product.
In Japan, the end users are obliged to pay fees for collection, take-back and recycling at the time of disposal. The government sets the fees to cover industryâ€™s actual costs for take-back, transportation, and recycling. They are (in U.S. dollars): washing machine, $24; air conditioner, $35; refrigerator, $46; and television, $27.
LG PolicyÂ of recycling and take-back.














The implications for the design cycle and product cycle depend on the nature of appropriate legislation. 

Impact for the designer â€¦ when designing

Impact for theÂ manufacturer â€¦

Added costs due to paying for it to be returned and recycled
Interested in design for disassembly and recyclability since they are most likely the ones pulling it apart and recycling or reusing
consider manufacturing techniques
consider material selection and reduction in products
collection systems need to be developed
manage the waste themselves or have a third party do it


Impact for the consumer â€¦

The extra costs may be passed onto he consumer
Must return the product
can rest assured that the environment is considered

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOLfDD00EGQ8.3 Sustainable design





The first step to sustainable design is to consider a product, service or system in relation to eco-designÂ and analyse its impact using life cycle analysis.Â The designer then develops these to minimize environmental impacts identified from this analysis. Considering sustainability from the beginning of the process is essential.




Datschefskiâ€™s five principles of sustainable design equip the designer with a tool not only to design new products, but also to evaluate an existing product. This can lead to new design opportunities and increase the level at which a product aligns with these principles.





Green design versus sustainable design
Green design: is designing in a way that takes account of the environmental impact of the product throughout its life
Sustainable designÂ Â is the philosophy of designing physical objects, the built environment, and services to comply with the principles ofÂ social,Â economic, andÂ ecologicalÂ sustainability. (Wikipedia)

Â Shorter (than sustainable design) therefore easier and cheaper to address environmentalÂ concerns in products.
Longer timescale which can affect the R & D stage (system wide research needed) of the design process increases costs therefore may not be feasible.


Incremental idea generating techniques are feasible as possibly only small changes need to be made.
Idea generating techniques are more radical to re-think (over-haul/redesign) the nature of the product and ho it works



Â 




Datschefskiâ€™s five principles of sustainable design
Students need to develop an understanding of Datschefskiâ€™s five principles of sustainable design (The Total Beauty of Sustainable Products,Â 2001). The five principles are a holistic approach to sustainable design but only selected principles will be possible/applicable to some products.


Cyclic â€“Â The product could not only be made from recyclable materials but is also Â compostable, of organic materials or from minerals that are recycled in a continuous loop such as bio plastics.
Solar â€“ The energy (both embedded and in use) the product requires comes formÂ only renewable energy sources that is cyclic and safe.
Safe â€“ By-products products of the that are emitted into the environment (air, land & water) and â€™spaceâ€™ are non-hazardous, i.e. non polluting. The by-products areÂ â€œfoodâ€ for other systems. Hydrogen fuel celled carsâ€™ by-prodouct when in use is H2O.
Efficient â€“Â Requiring 90% less energy, materials and water than equivalent products in 1990.
Social â€“Â The productsÂ manufacture and usage should underpin basic human rights, safe work practises, fair trade principles and natural justice.

Something Extra8.4 Sustainable innovation

Sustainable innovation yields both bottom line and top line returns as developing products, services and systems that are environmentally friendly lowers costs through reducing the resources required. Designers should view compliance with government legislation as an opportunity for sustainable innovation.
As energy security becomes an ever more important issue for all countries, designers, engineers and inventors need to developÂ new ways of efficiently generating energy. As new energy production technologies become available, designers need to harness them to be used in new products to improve their energy efficiency.






Complexity and Timescale of Sustainable Innovation
Complexities:





Sustainable innovation relies on cooperation between different stakeholders such as government and manufacturing.

This is often difficult as both parties have differing views.
Sustainable innovation requires a radical change which is time-consuming and expensive so manufacturers are not so willing to consider sustainable innovation.


It is the broadest approach going beyond technical solutions. This approach is based on a socio-technical systemsÂ (interaction betweenÂ people land technology) intervention rather than just considering product improvement.



Timescale:


The huge timescale means that sustainability is difficult to maintain as conditions/criteria can change significantly, for example, a lengthy period of economic downturn. 
Sustainable innovation is a hugely complex concept that requires a long time for implementation, typically 20â€“40 years depending on the nature of the innovation.

Sustainable Strategies
Sustainable use of the planet will require multiple sustainability strategies, which will range from the entire system, the entire Earth, the local or regional.
Strategies starting at the highest system level are referred to as â€˜top-downâ€™, and strategies designed for components, local or regional, are referred to as â€˜bottom-upâ€™Â Integrating top-down/bottom-up sustainability strategies: An ethical challenge (PDF Download Available). [accessed Nov 26, 2015].
Top-down strategies

Management of resources, finances (controlling bank rates, etc) and so on.
It provides targets and measures for sustainability.
When considering sustainable innovation, designers are usually more comfortable with top-down strategies as it means investment and resources are more predictable and reliable.Â 

Examples of top-down and bottom-up strategies and the advantages and disadvantages for consumers/users
Bottom-up strategies

Strategies implemented from the â€˜bottomâ€™ such as regional or local (city or town) level.
These include local initiatives like Planting Tree Campaigns
Designers involved with bottom-up strategies are usually enthusiasts for the project and willing to make a commitment even though it may not be cost-effective to do so.Â 

Examples of top-down and bottom-up strategies and the advantages and disadvantages for consumers/users
Government intervention in innovation
There are various strategies that governments use to promote knowledge exchange and technology transfer, including:



regulationâ€”setting and policing rules to avoid or limit environmental issues caused by undesirable technologies

yet allow the manufacturer to still make profits








educationâ€”providing consumers with information and guidance in the choice of products and services that are more sustainable

such as eco and energy labels








taxesâ€”to penalize environmentally damaging technologies and influence consumer choice of sustainable products and services

outside Beijing the government is forcing companies to comply or they are fined and ultimately closed down






subsidiesâ€”to stimulate and support sustainable innovations.

sustainable innovation can cast the company profits so governments offer financial help or tax breaks.



A potential problem for designers is the changing political scene and associated policies, for example, within the domain of renewable energy.
Macro energy sustainability



Macro energy sustainabilityÂ concerns can be influenced through international treaties and current international energy policies, instruments for change and disincentives, and national systems changing policy when government leadership changes.
Kyoto Protocol on the reduction of green house gases.

In order for it to be successful all governments need to agree, for a while Australia and USA did not so many countries followed suit


Are there any other implications of how macro energy sustainability can be influenced?



Micro energy sustainability

Micro energy sustainabilityÂ can be influenced by government, through their role in raising awareness and changing attitudes related to energy use and the promotion of individual and business action towards energy sustainability.
Local governments installing Combined Heat and Power (CHP)
Are there any other implications of how micro energy sustainability can be influenced?

Energy security
How energy security can be influenced by energy demand/supply trends and forecasting, demand response versus energy efficiency, and smart grids

Energy demandÂ is rarely constant and this puts a responsibility on those that generate and manage the flow of energy to understand when peaks and troughs of energy use occur over the course of days, weeks and years. 

For example, in many countries, energy demand increases substantially during breaks and following popular TV shows as large numbers of people put the kettle on to enjoy a hot beverage.
Also, there may be particular periods during the night where energy use is at a minimum. In these situations it is vital that the power-generating stations are informed when to start and stop energy generation. 
The difficulty arises as massive amounts of electricity cannot easily be stored, excess energy generated at these times is wasted.
Demand/supply trends need to be predicted carefully to create a responsive and efficient energy supply.

http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/2014/jun/16/10-leading-sustainability-innovations9.1 Corporate Strategies

The success of a company relies heavily on the strategies it adopts. The evaluation of products, services and systems can inform the selection of the most appropriate strategies to follow that will enable a company to achieve its objectives.




The designer must consider the ethical implications of imitating the products of others and their implications on a cultural, economic, and intellectual property level.





Â The success of a company relies heavily on the corporate strategy it adopts. There are many different corporate strategies a company can consider.Â 
Pioneering Strategy
Pioneering means being ahead of the competitors by introducing a new product or innovation into the market first.
Apple Newton and 1st Generation iPhone

Pioneering, a corporate strategy, is the process of introducing new areas of thought or development in the design process.
Motorola introduced the 1st mobile phone in 1973 and commercially in 1983.
It is the most risky (costly) strategy but one with the potential for the largest gains.
A pioneering company requires a strong research and development (R&D) capability, which is expensive.
A pioneering company needs to be financially secure and requires product champions to push new ideas.
Consider the Sony or Apple companies and their various pioneering developments.
Good market research can offset some risk, but is problematic for novel products.
To be successful while using this type of corporate strategy, the firm must learn more about the consumer market by extensive market research.
This is recommended because the pioneering strategy is very risky due to the fact the firm is introducing a totally new, unknown, and unexpected product or service to the market.
Although pioneering is risky and costly, the profits that can be earned from this strategy balances with the risks

The risk of failure is considerably high because this product or service has never entered the market, thus making it is impossible to determine that the product will be a success or failure since the product/serviceâ€™s lack of experience in the market.Â 



Apple: In an interview, the CEO was asked if he was concerned that so many companies produced very similar products after Appleâ€™s releases. His reply was, no, as it shows that we are pioneering and ahead of the rest.
Imitative Strategy
The imitative strategy aims to develop a product similar to the â€œpioneeredâ€ product (an existing new product) as quickly as possible.Â It takes advantage of R&D invested by others, and is less risky, but is based on a strong development capability.
When the apple iPhone came out within months many of the other smartphone companies adopted similar touch screen technology, apps, and aesthetic principles.



1st Generation iPhone released in 2007
Samsung 1st Generation Smartphone released in 2008



The Success of Pioneering and Innovative Strategies

Consider the success of each between the two

The Success of Pioneering and Innovative Strategies
Examples of companies and products that have used the above strategies â€“ Apple vs Samsung
The Apple iPod is an example of a product developed using a pioneering strategy. At the time, there were no similar products on the market. As Apple has continued to develop products such as the iPhone and iPad, many electronics companies have mimicked the aesthetic style and functionality of their products.Â 



Â Hybrid Strategy
There are many benefits for a company using a hybrid strategy. Companies that use a mixture of pioneering, Â imitative strategies or any of the below ones listed, Â in order to:

maximize profit and sales
provides for a quick turn around
reduces R&D spending
reduces the risk of employing only a pioneering strategy.


Activity 9.1a: Describe a product that has been produced that was/is similar to an existing product (other than an Apple product) that was pioneering. Also, consider the relative success of the pioneering strategy.
Activity 9.1b: Describe a product that has been produced that was/is similar to an existing product (other than a Samsung product) that was imitative. Also, consider the relative success of aÂ imitative strategy.
Activity9.1c: Describe a product that has been producedÂ Â that are a result of a hybrid approach.Â Also, consider the relative success of a hybridÂ approach.

Market and Product Growth Strategies
Knowledgegrab on Ansoff Matrix for product and market growth strategies.
Market Penetration
Increasing sales to existing customers or finding new customers for an existing product.

For example, if there are 300 million people in a country and 65 million of those people have cell phones then the market penetration of cell phones would be approximately 22%. This would mean in theory there are still 235 million more potential customers for cell phones, which may be a good sign of growth for cell phone makers. In general, the older the offering or industry, the greater the market penetration.Â Â Web reference

Describe a strategy that a company would use to enhance market penetration.

Â A strategy a company may consider to enhance market penetration is product promotion.
Product promotion engages in propagating information about a product, product line, brand, or company.
More examples on market penetration.

Market Development

The video is good in illustrating market penetration although it does focus on the negative affects.
Finding new applications for existing products, thereby opening up new markets

Market development targets customers in a market segment who are not buying the companies products, for example Apple iPhone targeting Blackberry customers in the smartphone market segment.
Market development targets customers in other market segments such as Apple iPod customers being targeted by the iPhone.

Describe how a company would undertake market development.

The identification of new markets for products,
For example, nylon was originally developed for parachutes and now have varied uses including clothing, sports etc.

Activity9.1d:Â Locate a product that was or still is used in one market and that was later used in a different market or product.
Product Development
The creation of new, modified or updated products aimed mainly at a companyâ€™s existing customers.
Describe one example of how a company undertakes product development.

Consider adding variations to a product to develop a range of products building on an established brand,
For example, ice cream, snack food products, chocolate products (Kit Kat, Mars bars).

Variety of flavours from Coca-cola products
Product development, can be approached through many ways:

By enhancing the released product, adding new features i.e a camera on a phone, or video playback on an I-pod.
By increasing the products range, giving different designs and/or adding more options to certain ones.
The company may release many different types, of a certain general product, even if they are very different i.e different soda flavours under the same company name.

Activity9.1e: Â DescribeÂ a product that has been modified or updated products aimed mainly at a companyâ€™s existing customers.
Product Diversification
Increasing sales from new products [and]/or [new] marketsÂ 

Involves a company both in the development of new products and in selling those products to new companies.
High risk strategy.

Describe one example of diversification.

a company manufacturing three-pin electrical plugs may consider producing themÂ in a range of colours or from materials of different textures and/or material properties. (need to find a different example)


Activity9.1f:Â Locate an example of a product that was a result of diversification.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Corporate social responsibilityÂ is a form of self-regulation for a company and centres around the development of goals related to three areas:Â 





economicÂ 
social
environmental





Companies that consider corporate social responsibility as a goal need to assess the impact of their operations in relation to these three areas in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the disadvantages. 
Students need to consider the ways in which a company might achieve this and the evidence of effective corporate social responsibility for a major multinational corporation.

How corporate social responsibility may be a particular goal of a company whereby the aim is to manage the economic, social and environmental impacts of their operation to maximize the benefits and minimize the disadvantages

    Topic 2 Corporate Strategy  from Jutka Czirok9.2 Market Sectors and Segments





Designers must consider the market when targeting their product, service or system. The smaller the sector, the more the target audience will have in common. Companies may decide to compete in the whole market or only in segments that are attractive and/or familiar. A designerâ€™s understanding of the identified market is essential.
By identifying the market sectors and segments a product will be designed for,Â a designer can gain data directly from the perspective of the potential consumer.

Market Sector
Market Sector: A broad way of categorizing the kinds of market the company is aiming for.

Categories of market sectors
Designers need to clearly be able to identify theÂ needs of the target market and target audience. These can be classified into two categories:





Geographical sectors, which focus on the values, culture and characteristics of purchasers in that region along with purchasing power

Consumer needs vary between climatic regions where block heaters are used in Canada which would be of little use in Egypt


Client-based sectors, which may focus on consumers, industrial, public sector and commercial.

Watchmakers target income groups such as Tissot vs Swatch.


List of SectorsÂ from yahoo. Click on the sector and you will see smaller sections.








Block heaters for cars



Tissot vs Swatch Watch â€“ Client based sector



Â The influence of market sectors

Â if there is a technological advance then the products or services in that sector will change.
This change will influence the target markets.
Such as the size of microchips allowing for powerful portable devices leading to iPads and smartphones.

Products in Sectors

Products designed to be sold in one sector for example laptops would fall under the technology sector.
Products designed to be sold to more than one sector for example an iPhone â€“ technology and telecommunication sectors.
How multinational companies take into account market sectors in the design and manufacture of their products.

The difference between a market sector and market segment

Market sector is aÂ broad way of categorising the kinds of market the company is aiming for. The sectors have similar characteristics such a technology, utilities, telecommunications etc
Market sector explained on investopedia
Market segment is dividing up the markets into smaller segments targeting customersÂ that share characteristics.
They interact with one another by nature of their characteristics. Technology sector would govern who Â the segments are targeting, Â i.e. early adopters, gamers, etc. This in turn could influence the direction of the companies in the sector head.

Â Classifications of consumer market segments

Maket segmentation:Â Markets divided in to smaller segments where purchasers haveÂ similar characteristics and/or tastes.
Market segmentation described by theÂ Â Open University. Explains well why and how businesses can target segments.
A slideshare an intern on market segmentation.
The fact that the consumer market is divided in segments allows companies and organisations to develop promotional campaigns targeting specific segments.

For example business people for business class on airlines or executive automobiles.
This means the company can develop products that better suit the consumer of segment.



Types of Market Segments

income (high, middle and low levels of finance) â€“Â Daewoo and Corolla vehicles for price sensitive customers whereas Mercedes and BMW aim their cars at the more affluent.
profession (types of jobs one has which can influence social groups or personal interests) â€“ marketing e-book for executives,
age (babies, toddlers, tweens, teenagers, young adults, middle aged to the elderly) â€“ such as diapers/nappies for babies, toys for children, clothes for teenagers
family â€“ (single no kids, single kids, married two kids, empty nesters etc) â€“ a family with kids would purchase furniture that is more family orientated as opposed to a single living alone (trendy furniture).
values (the ethical, worthiness or importance of something that is held by an individual or group, opinions) â€“ environmentally friendly products vs a throw away society.
behaviour (shopping mannerisms, loyalty, occasion buying, such as impulsive, online vs brick â€˜n mortar, or the researcher) â€“ buying turkeys at christmas and thanksgiving (occasion buying), Apple customers (loyalty),
An idea listÂ for segments â€“ by no means an exhaustive list


Demographic Segmentation
Â 
How the needs of the market segments listed above impact on the design of products and scale of production.

In China there is a need of low cost street commuter bicycles (no gears, basket, simple brakes) to cater for a market segment of low income earners which is a large target market. The scale of production would be that of volume.
Mont Blanc pens target a market segment of middle to high income earners and possibly business men and women. These would be batch produced. The cheapest at an UK online pen store Â in April 2015 was Â£170. Whereas a a box of 60 Bic pens in the USA costs $15. These would be volume produced.

The development of a product family
Product family:Â A group of products having common classification criteria. Members normally have many common parts, assemblies and/or aesthetic elements. Â Â 
Companies and designers will develop a successful product or product range into product families. This further develops a successful market segment that is already familiar with the original product. For example, iPod then IPhone,, then iPad.
Designers often develop product families to extend a successful product range and to develop products for market segments that are already familiar with the original product.
Apple Product Family
Â 
Windows Product Family

International-mindedness:
Two broad categories of market sectors are geographical- and client-based, with specific segments varying greatly.
Theory of knowledge:
Gaining information on market sectors often employs many of the methods of gaining knowledge most closely associated with the human sciences. What are these methods of gaining knowledge, and how do they compare to the methods used in the natural sciences?

Mashable Infographic9.3 Marketing Mix





Empathy for, and understanding of the target audience is developed through thorough analysis of the market chosen. This informs several factors: the standards that end users demand; how and where to distribute and sell the product; how much they are willing to pay for a certain product and its quality; and how to communicate the launch of a product. Correct analysis of these factors could determine the success or failure of a product, despite its quality.
Marketing is often a new area for designers to consider. Exploring unfamiliar aspects of innovation improves their understanding of the market needs of the products they are designing.

Â Marketing mix

The â€œmarketing mixâ€ involves 4 variables or 4 Pâ€™s which areÂ product, place, price and promotion.
A company will through market research using these variables Â so the designer has Â an accurate brief of the requirements of the market. Helps to develop a marketing strategy.
MindtoolsÂ has a great set of questions to ask/research for Criterion For your project





The 4Ps:

Product:Â standardization of products
Place:Â  implications of internet selling for a company in relation to its supply chain and distribution network.
Price:Â cost-plus, demand pricing, competitor-based pricing, product line pricing, psychological pricing.
Promotion:Â advertising, publicity, personal selling.
Marketing Agenda Website has an Amazon example and explanation.

Product
Product StandardisationÂ â€œTheÂ processÂ of setting generallyÂ uniformÂ characteristicsÂ for a particular good orÂ service. Product standardization among theÂ goodsÂ provided by differentÂ businessesÂ operatingÂ in technology-basedÂ industriesÂ can be useful forÂ consumersÂ since itÂ permitsÂ competitionÂ among the variousÂ suppliers.â€ Â â€“ from theÂ Business Dictionary
The standardization of products is perform inÂ three ways â€¦
1.Â Government standards for a particular market segment:Â 

Is where a governments sets standards for products. For example in Europe that need to set a Health and Safety standard for a product as not to harm the user. It is the CE mark on most electrical devices.
The CE mark can be used in other countries such as China. Take a look at your mobile phone. So to the website for moreÂ information.

EU Standard
2. Component standardization:Â Â 

Is where a part standardised,
e.g. USB ports or plugs, so they can be used in different or similar products, such as memory sticks or computers.

USB Standards
3. Industry-wide standards:Â 

For a period architects and engineers would ask steel companies for all sorts of sectional beams for buildings.
This became inefficient and expensive.
So the steel industry in agreement with the architects and engineers developed a limited range of sectional beams.

Sectional Beams for buildings
Consider examples of trigger products and incremental products.
Place
The location of the product where it will be sold that is convenient for the customer.Â This could be:

Bricks and Mortar

a physical location such as a store
Boutique, chain, super or hyper makes, etc

Advantages:

you can try/touch/see it in real life.
Find similar products nearby


Disadvantages:

commute to store (find parking),
higher price (store cover costs of rent, distribution, etc)
time for travel and shopping around






Online (internet)

such as Taobao or Amazon
Companies need to ensure/plan for aÂ supply chainÂ and distribution network. If the supply chain breaks time it will delay the delivery the product to the customer.
News ArticleÂ from the Independent

Advantages:

Convenience: can shop from anywhere
Possibly lower prices


Disadvantages:

Shipping time and costs
Returns if the item is not what you expected
Cost incurred for returns






Hybrid Model

There is a shop front perhaps in a mall but they also have an online presence as well.


Direct from the manufacturer

Price
An extremely important aspect of marketing a product is setting the correct price that will attract consumers to make a purchase while generating profit. Without getting the balance right, a company can quickly find that they are losing money through lack of sales or through lack of profit generation. The following strategies for setting price can be used:



Calculate costs






Cost-plus pricing



This isÂ Â where a company will add a percentage to the total costs for a product as a profit margin.






Total costs include: production/manufacture, design, distribution etc.




Example:Â If the total cost of the product is $500 and the company wants a 10% profit then the final cost for the consumer would be $550.








Demand pricing



Is where a a company sets the price according to the demand for the product






Initially the price my be high to maximise profits. If demand wanes then the price will be lower to diffuse into the wider market.




Examples include smartphones like the IPhone or gaming consoles. They start of high because of the high desirability of the product but as the time passes desirability wanes or new technology (to introduced in new similar products) then price is lowered.








Competitor-based pricing



Is where a company prices its product based on or in comparison to the price of similar (competitor) products.






It may be price below, same as or higher that similar products.






Costs to produce similar products will beÂ about the same except there may be other features included, thus affecting the price or increasing desirability.




Examples include smartphones








Product line pricing



It is where a company sets the different prices for different products within a product lineÂ (a group of related products).




Example:Â Â a base price for a basic model, the next product up might have more features or be a better quality â€“ it would be a higher price, and so on throughout the line. Computers, where different models may cater for different consumers.






Psychological pricing.






Is where a company sets a price for a productÂ so the consumer feels they areÂ paying less. Example: A pair of shoes are priced at $45.99 as opposed to $46










Promotion
When selling a product, promotion is another key aspect. Depending on the nature of a product, its position within the product life cycle among other reasons, the forms of promotion can be different. 
These include:



advertising â€“Â an audio or visual form of marketing communication






publicity â€“Â giving out information about the product




personal selling â€“Â Door-to-door salesman, market stalls,

Examples of promotion campaigns for different products
Advertisement





International-mindedness:
When developing marketing campaigns, companies take account of different cultures and sectors in the target market.
Theory of knowledge:
Some advertisers emphasize the â€œscienceâ€ behind their products. Does this suggest that some people may see scientific knowledge as being more reliable than knowledge in other areas of knowledge?

Marketing Mix WebpageÂ â€“ Price Setting Strategies












https://themarketingagenda.com/page/1/9.4 Market research





Market research often identifies how to improve the product, service or system and increase its chanceÂ of success within a particular sector or segment. TheÂ price a user is prepared to pay is usually determined through market research. This in turn sets an upperÂ limit of cost to the design and production of aÂ potential product, service or system. Market researchÂ has a crucial role in determining the constraints a designer has to work within.




Often designers will work on projects that have new and radically unfamiliar contexts. This will deepen their understanding of market research, equipping them with a range of tools and skills that they can employ in many areas of life and empowering them as lifelong learners.









Types of Data

Primary vs Secondary
Qualitative vs Quantitative

Purpose of market research
There are many purposes of market research.



Gathering information in order to be able to generate new ideas for a product






Evaluating the market potential of products at various stages of development






Developing ideas into products to suit market requirements






Identifying suitable promotional strategies






Gathering information relating to demographics






Gathering information relating to family roles






Collecting data relating to economic trends






Taking into account technological trends and scientific advances






Gathering information about consumers




Considering consumersâ€™ reactions to technology and green design and the subsequent impact on design development and market segmentation

Relate these purposes to your own project work.





Consumersâ€™ reaction
To technology

Technophile: Someone who immediately welcomes a technological change â€“ early adopters.
Technocautious: Someone who needs some convincing before embracing technological change â€“ majority to late majority
Technophobe: Someone who resists all technological change Â â€“ laggards.

Green design:

Eco-warriors actively demonstrate on environmental issues
Eco-champions champion environmental issues within organizations
Eco-fans enthusiastically adopt environmentally friendly practices as consumers.
Eco-phobes actively resent talk of environmental protection

These attitudes have a subsequent impact on design development and market segmentation. This will direct the companies products to certain target markets.

Article on Cultivating the Green ConsumerÂ that consumer demand for green products.





Market research strategies
Understanding that market research is a key element of the design project, students need to select from a range of strategies that will help them find out what the client wants and needs. It is important to note that often, what the client thinks they want and what they need can be very different things. There are many strategies for the student to identify the need, which include:
Literature search:

The use of consumer reports and newspaper items to follow historical development. Useful sources of information could include CD-ROMs, such as encyclopaedias and newspapers, or more specific disks, subject-specific magazines and manufacturersâ€™ information.
many sources of information are available
there may be an abundance of data, which can be too time-consuming.
Data can be both qualitative or quantitative

Expert appraisal:

The reliance on the knowledge and skills of an expert in the operation of the product.Â For example, expert knowledge and advice are gained (compared to a user trial), but the expert may be biased.
Expert knowledge can help decide design direction.
It may also be difficult to locate an expert.
Data is usually qualitative.

User trial:

The observation of people using a product and collection of comments from people who have used a product.
The â€œuserâ€ is a non-specialist, which makes trials easier and cost-effective.
However, users may carry out tasks in different ways from those expected and be inexperienced.
Data is usually qualitative.

User research:

Obtaining usersâ€™ responses through questionnaires/surveys and interviews.
It is cheap and quick to conduct
The data collect if qualitative or statistics can be produced (quantitative)

Perceptual mapping:

Quickly compare a product to others in the market due to it being a graphical representation.
It is simple and easy to construct.
It is qualitativeÂ as itÂ examines consumer perceptions.
Could be biased.

Environmental scanning:



Slideshare on Environmental scanning




Environmental analysis is careful study of various factors influencing the business. It is the process by which organization monitor their relevant environment to identify opportunities and threats affecting their business.

Disadvantages include lack of detailed information or specifics of what constitutes these opportunities or threats it may need much more research or specific data to identify usable information. â€“ not yet ready needs fixing.
Students need to draw from the above list when identifying a design opportunity and, prior to this, must have developed an understanding of these strategies. To this end, they should consider the advantages and disadvantages of the research strategies listed above in relation to the nature, reliability and cost of the research and importance to the design development process.

In order to diffuse products into the marketplace, the identity of a company is typically embodiedÂ in a brand. The brand is communicated to the consumer through a value proposition. Designers help to communicate this by: building a strong user experience around the brand identity; determiningÂ content design; establishing the tone of message through advertisements; promotion.Â 

A brand encapsulates the identity of a company and its products. The brand designer needs to ensure that the message of a company is communicated clearly and creatively to allow them to stand out from the competition.











Brand: A product from a known source (organization). The name of the organization can also serve as a brand.












The role of the designer varies when taking into account brand image/identity

depending on the position of the new design within the innovation cycle. 
there are many different brands that are appealing to different market segments
thus will use different methods to promote loyalty.

Brand loyalty




BrandÂ Loyalty: Â Where a person has a favourite supplier and prefers to buy products from them rather than from other suppliers.




Brand Loyalty





Definition from Investopedia:

Brand loyaltyÂ is a result of consumer behavior and is affected by a personâ€™s preferences.
Loyal customers will consistently purchase products from their preferredÂ brands, regardless of convenience or price.
This is based on perception where the consumer will continue to repurchase the product as it is perceived to be superior to its competitors.
Examples of brand loyalty

Coke vs Pepsi
Apple Mac vs Windows PCs
MacDonalds vs Burger King
iPhone vs Android/Samsung


Interestingly, brand loyalty is not specific to a company but rather to itâ€™s product, for example, a consumer may find Nike football (soccer) boots the best but AdidasÂ sports shoes as preferred cross trainers.
Developing brand loyalty:Â Coca- cola, â€œHappiness in a bottleâ€ and â€œShare a Cokeâ€, is one of the globally recognised brands around.

Went from selling 9 bottles to billions in a year.

How brands appeal to different market segments

Suitable strategies for market research are important in gaining appropriate information for redesigning products.
 When designing a brand it is important to identify the needs and wants of the market segment the product is aiming towards. 
A product may require a different brand identity depending on the market segment they are targeting. 
On occasion, products will be rebranded for different segments based on:

geographic location â€“ international or local â€“ urban or rural
age â€“ teens, tweens, elderly, etc
gender
culture â€“ National or sub culture
McDonalds Market segmentation and Marketing MixÂ 

Mcdonalds has meals based on the future of the market.

Is there another market segment you can think of?



Â Contribution of packaging to brand identity.


Packaging contributes Â to brand identity. ItÂ helps companies to communicate their brand so that is highly recognisable.
Being highly recognisable allows for products to be easily seen and the point if sale. such as supermarkets which are inundated with soda options like Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
Good and unique packaging design will help promote this.
Companies will employ teams that design the packaging usually in conjunction with the branding department.
Sometimes the packaging may be outsourced to specialistÂ packaging designers.

Apple Packaging that is quality, solid and aesthetically pleasing. Promotes brand name, identity and loyalty.







Trademark andÂ Registered design
Â 

Starbucks Brand Infringement
A brand is very important to business as it forms a productâ€™s identity. Â Starbucks Brand Infringement

They become extremely valuable such as 61% of Cola Colasâ€™ worth is its brand (mentioned in the earlier youtube video).
A brand is important to a product. and can promote sales.

If a customer is loyal to a brand then they are likely to continue to purchase other products from that Brand. Apple, is a good example where many Mac laptop owners are likely to have bought an iPhone or iPad.
As a result aÂ brand image (e.g. the â€˜Nike Swooshâ€™) becomes a commodity in itself which then Â becomesÂ Â intellectual property, i.e. it needs protecting.
Trademark and registered design (see explanation below) infringementsÂ are wide spread with often the smallest or subtle changes to the trademark or restored design.
Infringements of trademarks and registered designs is quite commonplace for a wide range of products and some designers use their creativity to attempt to subtly disguise the infringement.











Coca Cola Bottle
Registered Design:

An intellectual property mark that protects a productâ€™s appearance.
This refers to the features of the productâ€™s shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation which is new and distinctive.
Coca Cola is an example where the Font and shape of the bottle areÂ protected.








Trademark


â€œA trademark is a word, symbol, or phrase, used to identify aparticular manufacturer or sellerâ€™s products and distinguish them from the products of another.Â 15 U.S.C. ï¿½ 1127. For example, the trademark â€œNike,â€ along with the Nike â€œswoosh,â€ identify the shoes made by Nike and distinguish them from shoes made by other companies (e.g.Â ReebokÂ orÂ Adidas)â€. From Harvard University Law






Trademarks and Registered DesignÂ Â are applied in terms of branding. Trademarks and Registered Designs not only help to protect a products image but but can be used product diversification. A Nike has a range of sports apparel (not just shoes) so a protected trademark can be used on shirts, pants, socks etc. You will see these symbols attached to a product branding features. Have a close look at coca cola or nike.




Publicity on brand image




There are many implications for a company of positive and negative publicity on brand image.
Article on Brand Image
A big challenge for designers is to maintain or improve the brand image while creating an innovative new productâ€”this is sometimes achieved through the corporate strategy of diversification.
In other words, to mitigate negativeÂ publicity on Â brand in one marketÂ segment which is enjoying Â positive publicity in another market segment.

Positive publicity obviously doesnâ€™t hurt. AppleÂ has had its fair share of publicity both negative and positive. The Positive publicity of it being an innovator, iWatch amongst other products, Â (Boston Globe article) allows it home forgiveness when negative publicity hits such as the iPhone 6 bending issues, dubbed BendGate (TechTimes article).


Negative publicity can diminish positive consumer perceptions of a brand. McDonalds brand image suffered for a while due environmental impact and healthy food issues. Â It has made big efforts to turn this around and maintain brand loyalty, thisÂ Prezi on McDonalds BrandÂ will illustrate this. Other companies include Exxon and BP oil spills, Ford motors (exploding tyres), ToyotaÂ and more.

Evaluating Global impact of branding

Look at examples of products affected by branding on a global scale.

Coca-Cola and Nike have become world leaders and have achieved market dominance and global recognition through branding


Brands need to be more socially and culturally aware now that they have gone global.

Swimwear companies marketing and selling their products in Italy may not be appropriate for Middle Eastern countries.
Language differences cause many problems for marketers in designingÂ advertisingÂ campaigns andÂ productÂ labels.
Colors can have different meanings in differentÂ culturesÂ which needs to considered to make sure the localÂ consumersÂ are not offended or pushed away from the product.
Cultures have a unique set of customs and taboos.

Boundless textbook for Topic 910.1 JIT & JIC





While inventory creates a safety net for companies, maintenance and potential waste of resources canÂ have significant implications for companies andÂ the environment. Manufacturers must evaluate and analyse each market and determine whether a JIT orÂ JIC strategy is the best to follow.
JIT and JIC are two production strategies used by manufacturers that have both advantages and disadvantages to them. A manufacturing company will choose one of these strategies to follow for many reasons that include the products they are producing, the nature of the market and the nature of the economy.

JIT vs JIC
Just in Time (JIT)

A situation where a company does not allocate space to the storage of components or completed items,
Instead orders or manufactures them when required.
Large storage areas are not needed
Items that are not ordered by customers are not made.

More information from thisÂ website.








Â 
Advantages

Â Storage â€“ no space required thus reducing costs
Efficiency â€“Â Highly flexible, easy set-up for short runs (because of cell production)
Stock control â€“ none required also no left over stock one the product becomes obsolete.
Waste â€“ elimination of waste due to overproduction, left over stock, idle time, product defects and material processing.
Traditions â€“ Â Factory organised in cells/modules instead of departments based on function


Disadvantages


Reliability â€“Â Part will need to be made, things could go wrong, delay in manufacture and transport to consumer
Capital investment â€“ high but machinery could be used for a variety of products
Distribution â€“ small delay as consumer waits for the manufacture and distribution.





JIT

A comparison



Â 
Just in Case (JIC)

A company produces a small stock ofÂ components or products and stores them as inventory.
This is Just-InCase a rush order comes they have Â ready supply.
Some products included may be products or components that take a long time to produce therefore reducing customer wait time.


Advantages

Distribution â€“ no delay as as parts are available.
Reliability â€“ Part is ready to be sent and probably has passed quality control.
Market demand â€“ manufacturer is able to keep up with a change in market demand


Disadvantages


Efficiency â€“Â Not as effeiecwet as it is organised in departments often offsite.
Capital investment â€“ high but machinery could be used for a variety of products
Â Storage â€“ space required thus increasingÂ costs
Waste -some waste due to overproduction, left over stock, product defects and material processing.
Traditions â€“ Â Factory organised in Â departments based on function usually offsite bringing about added costs and transportation time
Stock control â€“ required also, may left over stock one the product becomes obsolete or market direction changes.




International Mindedness
Effective business processes and practices developed in some countries have been exported successfully.
Theory of Knowledge




Manufacturers decide whether to pursue JITÂ or JIC as a production strategy depending on their perception of where the market is going. To what extent do different areas of knowledge incorporate doubt as a part of their methods?

Lean production considers product and process design as an ongoing activity and not a one-off task, and should be viewed as a long-term strategy.




The role of the workforce in lean production is paramount, relying on their wisdom and experience to improve the process, reducing waste, cost and production time. Recognizing this results in motivated workforces whose interests are in the success of the product.









Characteristics of lean production
Lean production considers product and process design as an ongoing activity and not a one-off task. It should be viewed as a long-term strategy that focuses on continual feedback and incremental improvement.Â 
The characteristics of lean production include:

JIT supplies/system
a highly trained, multi-skilled workforce
quality control and continuous improvement
zero defects
zero inventory






Lean Production



Â 
Ten Principles of lean production
There are several key principles of lean production. If any of these principles are not met this could result in failure or a lack of commitment. Â Without commitment the process becomes ineffective.

Elimination of waste from various areas (JIT) andÂ do itÂ well from the beginning.
Minimizing inventory
Maximizing production flow andÂ designing for rapid production changeover
Kaizan â€“ Continuous Improvement from everyone â€“ from management to workers. Without continuous improvement your progress will cease.
Respect for workersÂ orÂ empowering workersÂ (Humans, most reliable and valuable resource to any company)
Pulling production from customer demand orÂ meeting customer requirements
Designing for rapid changeover
Creating a reliable partnership with suppliers
Meeting customer requirements
Doing it right the first time

Advantages and disadvantages to lean production
Advantages

Increase consumer satisfaction due to cost reduction
Productivity has increased because of focus improvements and reduction in waste
Quality of product improvement and continuos improvement
Waste reduction
ReducedÂ impact on the environment
Adapt to market pull
Increase in profits
Improved work conditions for employees
Competitive advantage

Disadvantages

Change in worker and management attitude can be difficult to manage or to gainÂ Â complete buy in
Delivery times â€“ since no inventory is held in storage and breakdown in the system will cause delays
Supply problems
High initial capital costs

Value Stream Mapping &Â Workflow Analysis
Value stream mapping is a lean production management tool used to analyse current and future processes for the production of a product through to delivery to the consumer.

helps to identify Value and Waste in production

Workflow analysis is the review of processes in a workflow, 

for example, a production line,
 in order to identify potential improvements.

Value stream mapping and workflow analysis contribute to the design of an effective lean production method through:

Value stream mapping provides the big picture of the manufacturing process

Product family

A group of products having common classification criteria.
Members of a product family haveÂ many common parts and assemblies and production processes.
Investopedia onÂ Product Family
Advantages include:

Cost-effective due to â€“ reduced manufacturing costs, similar manufacturing techniques, similar supply chain, reduced R&D,
Allows companies to attract new customers to their brand though anÂ array of products that are similar but meet slightly different needs.
Customers asÂ they can rely on their positive experience with an existing brand.
Adapt easily to market demand such as theÂ iPhone 5SEÂ (shows and example of Â market pull)







Role of the workforce

Training

The development of a highly skilled workforce can build deep understanding of how the production process works and allow workers at all levels to identify areas of the workflow to be improved.Â 
This leads to the devolution of power


Devolution in power relating to process improvement

Understanding that the best people to identify improvements of a product or system are those who use it, companies striving for a lean production system ensure that all members of the workforce are able to contribute to the design of the system.Â 
This benefits the company, which is able to streamline processes and reduce costs and also empowers the workforce and gives them a sense of ownership and loyalty to the company.


Kaizen

A philosophy and commitment to continuous process and product improvement
It is considered an important aspect of an organizationâ€™s long-term strategy.
This has been central to the success of many Japanese companies such as Toyota.
It originated in Japan











Lead time

Lead timeÂ refers to the time quoted to customers (usually in days or weeks) between the date of purchase and the date of delivery.
It is basically the time frame it takes from the order of a product to itsÂ manufacture until it is delivery to the customer. This can be days or weeks in duration. This includes the production, set-up etc times.

Theory of Knowledge






The importance of the individual is recognized in design processes. Is this the case in other areas of knowledge?




International mindedness








The implementation of lean production has benefits for the global environment.


Something Extra â€¦10.3 Computer Integrated Manufacturing





When considering design for manufacture (DfM), designers should be able to integrate computers from the earliest stage of design. This requires knowledge and experience of the manufacturing processes available to ensure integration is efficient and effective. Through the integration of computers, the rate of production can be increased and errorsÂ in manufacturing can be reduced or eliminated, although the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes.




The integration of computer control into manufacturing can streamline systems, negating the need for time-consuming activities, such as stocktaking, but also reducing the size of the workforce.





Â CIM








A system of manufacturing that uses computers to integrate the processing of production, business and manufacturing in order to create more efficient production lines.
Programmable computer based manufacturing system
Typically, it relies on closed-loop control processes, based on real-time input from sensors
Wikipedia reference






Elements of CIM:

Design (CAD) â€“ the product is designed within the CAD software, tested and the necessary G-Code, materials, and other data is generated.
Planning â€“ the computer system and database (contains design and production data) helps to plan the most efficient production process.
Purchasing â€“ with the design and production the computer system can employ a JIT approach in purchasing the necessary materials.
Cost accounting â€“ is the budgeting of the production process, receipts, and all things financial.
Inventory control â€“ responsible for tracking the materials, products, again JIT can be employed.
Distribution â€“ is receiving materials and the distribution of products to warehouse or vendors.






CIM and scales of production


It is costly to set up
Therefore it is better suited for large scale production such as batch, volume or mass
Advantages and disadvantages of CIM in relation to different production systems




Scale ofÂ Production
Advantage
Disadvantage


One â€“ off or small scale



Â Costs are too to high to be used therefore not suited
Not suited for non-complexÂ products




Batch, Volume or Mass

Suited for volume and mass due to the fully automated nature of CIM
Monitoring of system at all times
Great machine utilisation
Fewer errors and waste
Improvements in productivity and quality control
Greater consistency
Cheaper products
Parts easily manufactured and changed
Random introduction of parts
Less lead time
Less labor
Higher quality of finish

Mass Customisation


More choice,
Can design in own requirements
cheaper products
Parts easily manufactured and changed
Random introduction of parts
Less lead time
Higher quality of finish




High initial investment and personnel,
Training cost
Job losses





Advantages and disadvantages of CIM in relation to initial investment and maintenance
Advantages:

System is constantly monitored so if there is a breakdown: the type and location of breakdown is easily identified making maintenance easier
reduces cost of maintenance
After the high initial greater profits will be achieved

Disadvantage:

high initial capital costs/investments due to computers, robots, training of personnel
maintenanceÂ Â is complex, requires highly skilled employees

Something Extra â€¦10.4 Quality Management





Designers should ensure that the quality of products
 is consistent through development of detailed manufacturing requirements. They also need to focusÂ on the means to achieve it. The importance of quality management through quality control (QC), statistical process control (SPC) and quality assurance (QA) reduces the potential waste of resources.




The implementation of quality management strategies requires a critical and complete understanding of the needs of a product. To ensure efficiency and efficacy, these measures need to be designed into the product and its production system.









https://youtu.be/TiuaFwzJ4FU
QC, SPC and QA are important aspects that contribute to quality management.
Be sure to identify the differences between Â QC, SPC and QA .
Quality control (QC)

Tolerances are defined at the design stage of the machinery. Parts not within tolerance need to be reworked or scrapped. 
Continuous monitoring ensures that the machines perform to the pre-determined standard/quality.
Ensures that process inputs, such as speed, temperature, pressure, etc, are monitored an adjusted.
Quality control at the source eliminates waste from defects as workers are responsible for the quality of the work they do.
Able to get the same results over time


Quality assurance (QA)

This covers all activities from design to documentation.
It also includes the regulation of the quality of raw materials, assemblies, products and components, services related to production, and management and inspection processes.
It is the maintenance of the entire system from design to purchasing to packaging that meets quality requirements.




QA
Process orientated
Pro-active
Prevent defects


QC
Product orientated
Reactive
Find defects



Statistical process control (SPC)

This is a quality control tool that uses statistical methods to ensure that a process operates at its most efficient. 
This is achieved through measuring aspects of a component to ensure that it meets the required standard throughout its production in order to eliminate waste.Â 



















International Mindedness




Effective quality management can have major benefits for the environment.
















Theory of Knowledge




There are commonly accepted ways of assuring quality in design. How do other areas of knowledge ensure the quality of their outputs?10.5 Economic Viability





Designers need to consider how the costs of materials, manufacturing processes, scale of production and labour contribute to the retail cost of a product. Strategies for minimizing these costs at the design stage are most effective to ensure that a product is affordable and can gain a financial return.




The economic viability of a product is paramount for designers if they are to get their product into production. Understanding how to design a product to specification, at lowest cost and to the appropriate quality while giving added value, can determine the relationship between what a product is worth and how much it costs.











Cost-effectiveness

The most efficient way of designing and producing a product from the manufacturerâ€™s point of view.
Costs that the manufacture is likely to incur, such as, capital costs (machinery and factory), R&D, Marketing, energy, overheads, taxes, profits, storage etc

Â Value for money

The relationship between what something, for example a product, is worth and the cash amount spent on it
The consumer decides if it was well worth spending the money on something.
It is an individual judgement and different peopleÂ will value something differently.





Costing versus pricing:

In production, research, retail, and accounting, a cost is the value of money that has been used up to produce something.
Pricing is the process of determining what a company will receive in exchange for its product or service. The potential profit.
More examples include labour, manufacturing costs, costs relating to availability and procurement of materials, profits and taxes, size and weight of product for storage and distribution, resources, distribution and sales.

Fixed costs

The costs that must be paid out before production starts, for example, machinery. These costs do not change with the level of production.
Fixed costs, indirect costs or overheads are business expenses that are not dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the business, i.e., not reliant on output.
More examples include, scale of production, complexity of product, skills, quality control, type of advertising and marketing, R&D, capital costs, overheads, labour (directly related to production output).

Variable costs

Variable costs are costs that change in proportion to the goods or service that a business produces, i.e.Â reliant on output.
These costs are incurred once production starts.
These include, materials (processed and raw), utilities (electricity, water etc), wages, storage, distribution.
Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total cost.

Costs
Cost analysis

It is a tool used to determine the potential risks and gains of producing a product.
It is used by manufacturers to determine the break-even point for a product and can be used to create multiple scenarios for a product.
It allows the feasibility of a product to be established.

Break-even

It is the point of balance between profit and loss. It represents the number of sales of a product required to cover the total costs (fixed and variable).
The break-even level or break-even point (BEP) represents the sales amountâ€”in either unit or revenue termsâ€”that is required to cover total costs (both fixed and variable). Total profit at the break-even point is zero. Break-even is only possible if a firmâ€™s prices are higher than its variable costs per unit.

Break Even Point

Calculating Product Price


Designers must consider encomium feasibility of their designs.
When companies calculate the price of their products they use Pricing Strategies described below.
Often more than one strategy would be used.
The below strategies can be used in conjunction with the Price Setting Strategies listed in topic 9.3: Marketing mix.

Price Setting Strategies include:Â cost-plus pricing,Â demand pricing,Â competitor-based pricing,Â product line pricing,Â psychological pricing.


















Pricing strategies:
Price-minus

The market demand determines the product pricing (selling price) before manufacturing begins.
Then all commercialÂ costs (manufacture, profits, etc) are determined and the company works within these constraints.

Retail price

It is the recommended retail price (RRP) suggested by the manufacturer (MSRP) that the retailer should sell the product for.
It is to standardise prices
Some retailers will sell below the RRP to lure customers.

Wholesale price

The cost of a product sold by the wholesaler.
The product costs more than the manufacturer but less than the retailer.

Typical manufacturing price

It is the total costs (variable and fixed) to manufactureÂ the product. Divide the total manufacturing/product costs by the total products/items produced to get the average cost/price per unit.
Once total costs are determined then a profit margin is added.
The goal is to maximise profit.

Target cost

It is desired final cost of aÂ product Â isÂ determined before manufacturing begins.
This is based on the competing pricing.
Profit is then removed to determine initial cost.
The product is design or designed to meet it
Wikipedia on target costing

Return on investment (ROI)

Receiving a profit (return) on money investedÂ into the product or service.
Usually expressed as a percentage.
The higher the ROI the better return

Unit cost

The costs a company incurs to produce store and sell one product (item).
This is calculated as an average cost.
These include fixed and variable costs

Sales volume

It is the amount of products sold in a specified time period during regularÂ working operationsÂ of a company.
They can be annual, quarterly, etc sales
Can also be based on demographics, geographic regions, etc

Financial return

It is the profitsÂ generated from a sale or investment into a company.

Activity:Â Calculation of prices based on the listed pricing strategies.
